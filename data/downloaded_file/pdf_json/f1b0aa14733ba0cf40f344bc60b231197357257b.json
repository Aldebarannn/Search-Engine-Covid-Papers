We analyze the circulation of controversial topics associated with the origin of the virus, which involve popular targets of misinformation, such as migrants and 5G technology. We collected over 1.5 M posts in Italian language and related to COVID-19, shared by nearly 80k public pages and groups for a period of four months since January 2020. Overall, we find that potentially harmful content shared by unreliable sources is substantially negligible compared to traditional news websites, and that discussions over controversial topics has a limited engagement w.r.t to the pandemic in general. Besides, we highlight a \"small-worldness\" effect in the URL sharing diffusion network, indicating that users navigating through a limited set of pages could reach almost the entire pool of shared content related to the pandemic, thus being easily exposed to harmful propaganda as well as to verified information on the virus.",

Italy, in particular, has been one of the first European countries to be severely hit by the pandemic, as the virus spread outside China borders at the end of January, and to implement national lockdown on the 9th of March [1, 2] . Following Italy and China, national lockdowns have been adopted by most countries around the world, drastically reducing mobility flows in order to circumvent the spread [3] .",

In response, several contemporary works have provided different perspectives on this phenomenon. Authors of [5] analyzed more than 100 millions Twitter messages posted worldwide in 64 languages and found correspondence between waves of unreliable and low-quality information and the epidemic ones. Authors of [6] have investigated the prevalence of low-credibility content in relation to the activity of social bots, showing that the combined amount of unreliable information is comparable to the retweets of articles published on The New York Times alone. Finally, authors of [7] have carried out a comparative analysis of information diffusion on different social platforms, from Twitter to Reddit, finding different volumes of misinformation in different environments.",

We thus use the term \"disinformation\" as a shorthand for unreliable information in several forms, all potentially harmful, including false news, click-bait, propaganda, conspiracy theories and unverified rumours [20, 21] . We use instead the term \"mainstream\" to indicate traditional news websites which convey reliable and accurate information. This approach has been mainly used for Twitter, which however exhibits a declining trend as a platform to consume online news [12, 17] . Similar to [22] , we leverage Crowdtangle platform to collect posts related to COVID-19 from Facebook public pages and groups. We use a set of keywords related to the epidemic and we limit the search to posts in the Italian language. The overall dataset accounts for over 1.5 M public posts shared by almost 80k unique pages/groups. We investigate the prevalence of reliable vs non-reliable information by analysing the domain of URLs included in such posts. In particular, we are interested in understanding how specific disinformation narratives compete with official communications. To this aim, we further specify keywords related to three different controversial topics that have been trending in the past few months, all related to the origins of the novel coronavirus: (1) the alleged correlation between COVID-19 and migrants, (2) between the virus and 5G technology, and (3) rumours about the artificial origin of the virus.",

When considering separately accounts who discussed on controversial topics, we observe on average an higher activity compared to the global set of accounts, but we do notice similar distributions of members; therefore, we analyze the distribution of members versus the other dimensions (see Figure 2 left, centre) and we notice that (1), as expected, accounts with a larger number of members are more active but also (2) they were more likely involved in discussions on controversial topics. These results do not change if we consider Groups or Pages alone. We also consider the relative change in the number of members/likes of accounts during the observation period. We observe that groups have larger oscillations and higher (positive) growths compared to pages (see Appendix, Fig. A3) ; also, we notice that accounts which discussed about controversial topics experienced a larger growth compared both to the entire set and to those which did not discuss about any of them (see Figure 2 right). However, further investigation is needed to understand whether there is a causality effect between discussing about specific topics and experiencing a growth in followers/members. We then analyzed the total engagement generated by different accounts to understand which were the most influential in general and for each topic. In the former case in the Top-10 ranking (see Appendix, Table 2 ) we encounter 5 pages related to newspapers, 1 to a popular pseudo-journalistic TV program (Le Iene) and 4 pages related to right-wing politicians (in particular 2 pages of Matteo Salvini and 1 page of Luca Zaia, governor of Veneto region which was one of the most affected by the virus).

We notice a trimodal distribution: a peak at \u03c1 = 1 representing accounts not talking about controversial topics (the greater majority of accounts), a second peak at \u03c1 = 0 that includes accounts talking equally about controversial and not controversial topics, and a third lower peak at \u03c1 = \u22121 which represents accounts posting only about controversial topics. In the Appendix ( Figure A5 ), we show also how accounts are polarized when comparing topics against each other with the same rationale, i.e., by defining p a the number of posts about one controversial topic (e.g., 5g) and p b the number of posts about a different controversial topic (e.g., Labs). Peaks at \u03c1 = +1 and \u03c1 = \u22121 indicate that most accounts usually do not talk about more than one controversial topic.",

Quite interestingly, a similar scenario emerges if we only consider the set of controversial URLs: this bipartite subgraph has 55,411 vertices (18,681 accounts and 36,730 urls) and 81,707 edges, and its giant component includes \u2248 72% of both accounts and URLs and \u2248 87% of all edges.

Through manual investigation, we verified that such phenomenon is oftentimes caused by a website controlling one or more Facebook pages to promote its articles. A notable case is \"howtodofor.com\", which seems to use as many as 17 different accounts, none of which is apparently ascribable to the website owners.

This means that we observe Facebook accounts which often share common sets of URLs. At the same time, visiting a small percentage of them is enough to cover all the URLs shared in the network, as showed in Figure A7 . Altogether, this suggests that if Facebook allowed users to \"jump\" through groups and pages via shared URLs, they would likely get to all controversial URLs no matter the stance towards the topic. On the one hand, finding propaganda items on Facebook appears an easy task; on the other hand, debunking articles are probably equally easy to find, if the right instruments for browsing content were provided.",

As a side result, we expect to gain insights into the possibility to infer the quality of web content solely based on where and who shared the item. We computed modularity-based clusters relying on the well-known Louvain algorithm [27] . In Figure 5 we compare the ratio of Mainstream URLs with the ratio of Disinformation URLs present in each cluster, and in the entire graph of URLs/accounts. We see that the ratio of deceptive URLs is very low for almost all clusters, and that in general news-related URLs are a minority. This is mainly a consequence of the high prevalence of domains relying on user generated content and that, as such, cannot be classified -e.g., \"facebook.com\" and \"youtube.com\" account for, respectively, \u2248 48% and \u2248 4% of all URLs.",

Ten domains appear in cluster 2, and they are all well-known websites which share sovereignty propaganda and false stories (from \"voxnews.info\" to \"ilprimatonazionale.it\"). However, the cluster also includes URLs from 20 Mainstream domains, showing that propaganda is apparently well-mixed with Mainstream information. Conversely, the only strongly polarized cluster of URLs, which includes almost 60% of disinfo URLs, is in reality similar to the small connected components discussed in Section 4.1 and, as such, of limited interest: it is very small (less that 100 URLs), dominated by just a few domains, and apparently consisting of a few web sites promoting each other.",

Besides, all of these belong to the aforementioned cluster 2, which includes other widespread content as well: 2 news items from mainstream media outlets but very popular among conspirationists (an interview to an \"expert\" claiming that the virus is indeed a biological weapon, published by \"TgCom24\", and an article about the role of particulate in the epidemics, published by \"AGI\"); finally, a few URLs linking to scientific papers, data analysis and visualization of the pandemic. Two insights can be drawn: on the one hand, propaganda items are so popular that they invade the general debate on Facebook and are often found in accounts that also share factual and rigorous news items; on the other hand, a categorization of disinformation domains is useful but insufficient, because most popular disinformation content is shared as user generated content on platforms such as Youtube and Facebook, thus needing manual verification to flag them as harmful.",

We then observed that, in accordance with recent literature, sources of (supposedly) reliable information had a higher engagement compared to websites sharing unreliable content. However, we also realized the limitations of source-based approaches when analyzing an information ecosystem wherein user generated content has a paramount role. Finally, we highlighted a \"small-world effect\" in the sharing network of URLs, with the result that users on Facebook who navigate on a limited set of pages/groups can be potentially exposed to a wide range of content, from extreme propaganda to verified information.
