            "text": "A growing number of studies support a tendency toward preferential host switching, by parasites and pathogens, over relatively short phylogenetic distances. This suggests that a host switch is more probable if a potential host is closely related to the original host than if it is a more distant relative. However, despite its importance for the health of humans, livestock, and wildlife, the detailed dynamics of preferential host switching have, so far, been little studied. We present an empirical test of two theoretical models of preferential host switching, using observed phylogenetic distributions of host species for RNA viruses of three mammal orders (primates, carnivores, and ungulates). The analysis focuses on multihost RNA virus species, because their presence on multiple hosts and their estimated ages of origin indicate recent host switching. Approximate Bayesian computation was used to compare observed phylogenetic distances between hosts with those simulated under the theoretical models. The results support a decreasing sigmoidal model of preferential host switching, with a strong effect from increasing phylogenetic distance, on all three studied host phylogenies. This suggests that the dynamics of host switching are fundamentally similar for RNA viruses of different mammal orders and, potentially, a wider range of coevolutionary systems.",

Therefore, the study of their infection dynamics is important for human health (Jones et al. 2008) , livestock economics, and environmental conservation (Cleaveland et al. 2001 ). However, we still know relatively little about the evolutionary factors affecting host identity and range (the type and number of host species exploited) among viruses (Longdon et al. 2011) , and pathogens and parasites in general (Perlman and Jaenike 2003) . RNA viruses are widely distributed among mammal species, suggesting an ancient origin (Holmes 2008) . Furthermore, it has recently been shown that RNA viruses have left \"fossils\" dating to millions of years ago, in the form of endogenous viral elements integrated into host genomes (reviewed by Holmes 2011) . Previously, matching phylogenetic branching patterns for some extant RNA viruses and their hosts had been thought to suggest a similarly ancient history for living viral strains, characterized by cospeciation with their hosts over hundreds of thousands, to millions, of years (reviewed by Holmes 2003) . However, the majority of RNA viruses appear to have high rates of mutation, indicating an age in the order of hundreds of years for most extant virus taxa below the family level (Holmes 2003 (Holmes , 2008 .",

            "text": "This apparent discrepancy can be explained by a model of \"preferential host switching\" (Charleston and Robertson 2002) , in which a virus is more likely to successfully colonize a new host species if this is a close relative of the original host than if it is a more distant relative (for similar concepts in the earlier literature, see Jermy 1984; Menken 1996, e.g.) . In this model, switches to phylogenetically distant hosts are possible, but are considered less probable than switches between more closely related host species. Such preferential host switching is expected because barriers to infection will depend on the physiological similarity between original and potential host species (Poulin 2005) ; factors that can depend strongly on host phylogeny. This is, in turn, because phylogenetic distance represents a general proxy for physiological and ecological similarity, due to the evolutionary inheritance of traits such as suitability for parasite replication (Ohishi et al. 2010) , immune defenses (Longdon et al. 2011 ), nutrient quality (Poulin and Mouillot 2003; Poulin 2005) , and body size (Clayton et al. 2003a; Bush and Clayton 2006) . ( We acknowledge that species-specific differences in pathogen susceptibility are likely to lead to natural variation around this overall trend, e.g., Harder and Osterhaus 1997; Poulin and Mouillot 2003; Poulin 2005.) In some cases preferential host switching may also be promoted by phylogenetic covariance in the opportunity for infection, for example, if recently diverged host species tend to have overlapping geographic ranges (Poulin and Mouillot 2003; Davies and Pedersen 2008 ; but see also Daszak et al. 2001) .",

Both models have been proposed before now (Charleston and Robertson 2002; Engelst\u00e4dter and Hurst 2006) , but it has not previously been possible to test or compare them using real host-pathogen association data. The first, exponential, model is based on the simple notion that a parasite or pathogen colonizing a new host will have reduced fitness on that host if it represents a dissimilar physiological environment to that of its original host (as introduced above). The second, sigmoidal, model derives from the idea that there will be a certain tolerance of pathogens to new environments, within which they may remain optimally or near-optimally fit, but beyond which the combination of multiple factors' deviation from the environment to which the parasite has adapted will become too much and fitness will rapidly decline. These two models can neatly be described by an exponential and half of a Gaussian (sigmoidal) function, respectively (see eq. 2, below). A potential example of a pathogen with a phylogenetically restricted, tolerable host range and infrequent host switches beyond this range (as predicted by the sigmoidal host-switching model) is Influenza A virus. This is apparently more easily transmitted between bird species (the reservoir hosts) than to other animals, due to adaptation of virus subtypes to hostspecific surface receptors (Webster et al. 1992; Dugan et al. 2008; Band\u00edn and Dopazo 2011; Gambaryan et al. 2012 ). On the other hand, a pathogen that appears to show an immediate reduction in infectivity with increasing phylogenetic distance from the original host (as predicted by the exponential host-switching model) is measles virus, MV. For this virus, frequency of wild transmission appears considerably higher among humans, the natural hosts, than to nonhuman primates (de Swart 2009) and, even more so, to other mammals such as rodents (D\u00f6rig et al. 1994; Wyde et al. 2000) .",

Current methods of cophylogenetic analysis (implemented in programs such as TreeMap (Charleston and Robertson 2002) and Jane (Conow et al. 2010) ) are designed to test hypotheses of cospeciation, and the reconstructions they produce are expected to decrease in optimality as the actual incidence of cospeciation declines (Percy et al. 2004) .

Although most pathogens are likely to experience some level of species barrier (giving reduced infectivity among individuals of an unusual host species), the majority of pathogens may have the potential to infect multiple host species . Two alternative evolutionary processes have generally been suggested to explain the presence of a pathogen species on multiple hosts (Banks and Paterson 2005) . One process involves association by evolutionary descent, in which divergent host species inherit a pathogen that does not, itself, speciate (referred to, e.g., as failure to speciate (Johnson et al. 2003; Banks and Paterson 2005; Clayton et al. 2003b) or to diverge (Conow et al. 2010) ). The other process involves association by colonization, in which one parasite population switches host, but does not speciate from a population maintained on the original host (which we refer to here as incomplete host switching, after Clayton et al. 2003b ). Failure to speciate and incomplete host switching are comparable to the cophylogenetic events for singlehost parasites of, respectively, cospeciation (which involves association by descent; but with parasite speciation) and host switching (which involves association by colonization; but with either parasite speciation or extinction of the parasite population on the original host (Clayton et al. 2003b) ). However, we note that currently available cophylogenetic methods are able to fully reconstruct only one of these theoretical events for multihost parasites (failure to speciate, which can be reconstructed by the software package Jane 3 (Conow et al. 2010) ). For extant RNA viruses, failure to speciate is ruled out by their young age relative to their host species (as implied by current estimates of substitution rates for the majority of RNA viruses (Holmes 2003) and discussed below). This leaves host switching-in this case incomplete, that is, without virus speciation-as the most probable evolutionary mechanism for the spread of a given RNA virus species to multiple host species. The distribution of RNA viruses on the phylogenies of their mammal hosts, therefore, provides a record of host-switching dynamics that allows us to test alternative theoretical models of preferential host switching.",

One potential problem for the identification of multihost viruses, and multihost parasites in general, is the accurate designation of species (e.g., Van Regenmortel 2011). For example, lumping of distinct parasite populations with different hosts into a single species might lead to overestimation of the number of host species exploited. To minimize this possible effect, the dataset was screened to ensure all included viruses were classified to the species level. We also note that the recent age of origin inferred for the majority of extant RNA viruses (Holmes 2003) suggests that any distinct strains, incorrectly lumped within the same species, would still represent very closely related lineages that achieved their current host range by host switches (the subject of this study).",

To test for such sampling bias, we measured sampling effort for each species of virus, or host, included in the dataset and checked for a relationship with the number of recorded hosts. As in previous studies of host range (e.g., Nunn et al. 2004 ), we estimated sampling effort using the number of citations for a given species in a comprehensive database of published articles, in this case the Web of Science (Web of Knowledge 2012). The number of citations for each virus was non-normally distributed for the viruses of primates and carnivores (primates: Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.317, P < 0.0001; carnivores: W = 0.676, P = 0.0005; ungulates: W = 0.982, P = 0.911). Similarly, the average number of citations per host (calculated for each multihost virus) was non-normally distributed for primates (primates: W = 0.812, P = 0.0008; carnivores: W = 0.946, P = 0.588; ungulates: W = 0.996, P = 0.987). Therefore, nonparametric Spearman's rank correlations were performed. Neither the number of citations for each virus, nor the average number of citations per host, was significantly correlated with the number of host species recorded for a given virus (virus citations, primates: P = 0.964; carnivores: P = 0.964; ungulates P = 0.667, average host citations, primates: P = 0.843; carnivores: P = 0.604; ungulates: P = 0.5).",

Spearman's rank correlations indicated that the sampling effort for each virus was not significantly correlated with HSD, for viruses of primates (P = 0.341), carnivores (P = 0.439) or ungulates (P = 0.083). Nor was the average number of citations per host species significantly correlated with HSD (primates: P = 0.126; carnivores: P = 0.72; ungulates: P = 0.75). Furthermore, HSD was found to be normally distributed for all viruses of all three mammal orders (primates: W = 0.945, P = 0.254; carnivores: W = 0.178, P = 0.904; ungulates: W = 0.998, P = 0.995).

A j ) is the length of the branch incident to host leaf i (resp. j). HSD is similar to previously proposed measures of phylogenetic host specificity (Poulin and Mouillot 2003; Poulin, Krasnov, and Mouillot 2011) , but considers distances between branch midpoints rather than distances between leaves. Branch midpoints were used to model host switch events from a \"take-off\" site, at an unknown point along the branch to one of the host leaves, to a \"landing\" site, at an unknown point along the branch to another host leaf. Although this was the biologically motivated method of calculation, simulated phylogenetic distances between leaves were similarly distributed to those calculated between midbranch points (data not shown). HSD was not found to be significantly correlated with the number of hosts for viruses of primates (linear correlation P = 0.194), carnivores (P = 0.065), or ungulates (P = 0.295), suggesting that this measure of interhost phylogenetic distance is comparable for multihost viruses with different numbers of hosts (two hosts, three hosts, etc.). HSD values for each virus were then summarized by the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, calculated separately among the viruses of primates, carnivores, and ungulates. This provided four summary statistics for each host phylogeny, which could then be compared with similar statistics calculated for the data simulated under the theoretical models of preferential host switching (as described below).",

Under both models (Fig. 1) , the maximum possible probability of a host switch is given by the value of \u03b3 (achieved if d ij = 0). With a given value of \u03b2, the probability of a successful host switch decreases toward zero as phylogenetic distance increases, reaching \u03b3/2 when d ij = \u03b2 (Engelst\u00e4dter and Hurst 2006) . As the decay parameter \u03b2 decreases, the probability of a host switch at a given phylogenetic distance declines. Overall, both models describe a decrease in the probability of a successful host switch as phylogenetic distance increases. However, with a given \u03b2 value, the sigmoidal function (Fig. 1B) shows a smaller initial decline in host switch probability (when phylogenetic distances are small) followed by a steeper decline toward a host switch probability of zero (as the distance between host species becomes relatively large), compared with the exponential function ( Fig. 1 ) (as discussed below). We use 2 as the base of the exponent for consistency with previously proposed forms (Engelst\u00e4dter and Hurst 2006) , noting that changing the base is equivalent to scaling the \u03b2 value.",

Simulations were performed separately for the three consensus phylogenies (Primates, Carnivora, and Cetartiodactyla). The patristic distance matrix corresponding to each phylogeny was used to derive a matrix of the midbranch distances (d ij ) between each possible pair of hosts (as described above). The probability of host switch success under each of the two models (probability P e (i j) for the exponential model or P s (i j) for the sigmoidal model) was then calculated for each possible pair of host species, with values of the decay parameter \u03b2 ranging from 0.01 to 2 in steps of 0.01. For sampling purposes, host switch probabilities (for a given phylogeny and with a given \u03b2 value) were then normalized by dividing the probability calculated for each possible host pair by the total probability of host switching (the sum probability over all possible pairs of species). A random sampling procedure was then used to sample interhost phylogenetic distances, according to the normalized probability of each possible host switch. Sampling from the normalized probabilities (rather than non-normalized values) removes the effect of the phylogenetic constant \u03b3 (the probability of infection at a phylogenetic distance, d ij , of zero), and ensures that a phylogenetic distance is sampled at every iteration. This is suitable for comparison with our observed data, which records only the presence of a pathogen (rather than recording absence vs. presence of each pathogen across all potential hosts, e.g.). Each sampled distance d ij provides an estimate of host switch distance, HSD, where n = 2 (eq. 1). The sample size was set to match the recorded number of viruses for each host order (22 for Primates, 12 for Carnivora, and 4 for Cetartiodactyla). Four summary statistics were then calculated for each sample. These were the mean value of the HSD statistic (Fig. 2) , and its variance, skewness, and kurtosis (Figs. S1-S3). The use of these different sample sizes allowed us to test whether ABC could distinguish between simulations, with different models and parameter values, given sample sizes comparable to the numbers of viruses actually recorded in databases of host-pathogen associations, such as that used in our study. The sampling procedure was repeated 1000 times for each unique combination of host phylogeny, model, and \u03b2 value, and the calculated summary statistics (HSD mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis) were output for ABC. This procedure was also repeated using the average pairwise phylogenetic distance calculated on 1000 phylogenies sampled from the MCMC chain (rather than the consensus phylogeny, which was used in the main analyses). Taking the average pairwise distances, across the sampled phylogenies, approximately weights them by the relevant clade posterior probabilities. This allows us to test whether the main results (based on the consensus phylogeny) were robust to phylogenetic uncertainty, by comparison against the results based on average phylogenetic distance (across the range of topologies present in the MCMC sample).",

ABC allows model and parameter selection, and estimation of support for a selected model or parameter, under complex biological models for which computation of the likelihood function may be impracticable (Csill\u00e9ry et al. 2010 ). This is achieved by comparing summary statistics for observed data with similar statistics calculated for the simulated data. These comparisons are based on a rejection method, which repeatedly samples from the simulated statistics, accepting parameter values for a given simulation if the distance from the observed statistic is below a set threshold (which determines the proportion of accepted simulations). Accepted parameter values can be viewed as a sample from an approximate posterior probability distribution for that parameter. Regression techniques may then be applied to improve the estimates of distance between statistic values, and to produce a weighted and corrected approximation of the parameter posterior. Average posterior probabilities can then be calculated for different models, over the range of simulated parameter values, and compared using Bayes factors (Csill\u00e9ry 2012) . Bayesian confidence (or, credible) intervals were calculated from each estimated posterior probability distribution, giving the interval within which there is a 95% probability that the parameter value lies.",

Cross-validation for model and parameter selection was also performed to select the best performing ABC method and tolerance level, and to evaluate performance. Cross-validation for \"model\" selection repeatedly samples from the simulated data and records the percentage of samples for which the simulation model is correctly identified, based on the simulated summary statistics. Cross-validation for \"parameter\" selection repeatedly samples from the simulated data and calculates the prediction error for a given parameter (the sum of squared differences between true and estimated values divided by the variance (Csill\u00e9ry 2012) ). Based on cross-validation for parameter selection, the main analyses were performed using a linear regression method to improve posterior probability estimation (Csill\u00e9ry 2012 ) and reduce estimation error (relative to the simpler rejection method).

It is noteworthy that our tests across three mammal phylogenies (primates, carnivores and ungulates) all supported the same theoretical model and similarly strong effects from phylogenetic distance. These results suggest that strong preferential host switching, with a sigmoidal decay in the probability of a successful host switch as phylogenetic distance increases, may be a general characteristic of infection dynamics among mammal RNA viruses.",

First, it has been observed that small phylogenetic distances (such as those between sister species, or within a subgenus (Perlman and Jaenike 2003) or genus (Tinsley and Majerus 2007) ) can present very low barriers to host switching. Second, a number of recent studies suggest that the distribution of pathogens and parasites on the phylogeny of their hosts is affected by the phylogenetic distance between the host species (Charleston and Robertson 2002; Clayton et al. 2003a; Perlman and Jaenike 2003; Poulin and Mouillot 2003; Krasnov et al. 2004; Percy et al. 2004; Sorenson et al. 2004; Tinsley and Majerus 2007; Longdon et al. 2011) . Third, it has been suggested that host switches over very large phylogenetic distances are comparatively rare. For example, few pathogens or parasites have hosts in difference orders or classes (Gifford et al. 2005; Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 2005) and very few infect hosts in different phyla (Poulin and Mouillot 2003) .",

Increasing values of \u03b2 indicate a declining effect of phylogenetic distance. However, the average host switch distance modeled with a particular \u03b2 value depends on the distribution of branch lengths on the host phylogeny (Fig. 2) . Thus, the significant point is not the selected value of the \u03b2 parameter per se, but that the value supported for each phylogeny falls in the range where phylogenetic distance strongly affects the distribution of simulated host switches. This suggests that the dynamics of host switching by mammal RNA viruses have been strongly affected by host phylogeny.",

Our ABC procedure could perhaps be extended to incorporate estimates of \u03b3, based on statistics describing intrahost pathogen infectivity (e.g., see Tinsley and Majerus 2007) , though it is not yet clear how informative this would be. Here we have tested two simple models that could be compared with the available data. Of course, simply finding that one model is better supported than another does not mean that that model is the correct one in all cases: however, we regard this as an important first step in understanding the general dynamics of host switching by RNA viruses.

The same model, with similar decay parameter values, is supported for all three studied host phylogenies (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) . This suggests that the supported model is applicable across mammal RNA viruses, and may generalize to a wider range of coevolutionary systems.
