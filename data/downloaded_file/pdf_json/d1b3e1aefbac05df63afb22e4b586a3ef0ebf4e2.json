The highest mortality rate of the disease has been reported in the elderly, especially those with severe illnesses and immune deficiency. Currently, no definite treatments or vaccines are available for COVID-19, and recommendations mostly revolve around self-isolation and the observance of personal hygiene. To the elderly with cognitive impairment, functional dependence or living alone, it might be difficult to follow instructions, stay updated on the news or detect the signs or symptoms of the infection. Consequently, these individuals may be faced with challenges in communicating and explaining their pain or uneasiness, and the newly emerging pandemic becomes a profound health hazard in their cases (2, 4) . Brooke and Jackson have reported the risk of COVID-19 mortality to be 3.6% in the elderly in their 60s and 8.0% and 14.8% in those in their 70s and over 80s, respectively based on the Oxford COVID-19 Evidence Service Data (5).",

On the other hand, the limited resources available to provide healthcare services to patients are a major challenge in this regard, which often emerges within the first days of the pandemic when the healthcare system is unexpectedly faced with a large number of patients without access to sufficient equipment, staff, and facilities. As such, the healthcare system or patients may suffer numerous consequences due to unpreparedness (6) . During this pandemic, some of the main issues faced by the healthcare system include the limited special equipment (e.g., ventilators, pulse oximeter, intensive care unit beds), overcrowding of patients in emergency departments, high infectivity of COVID-19, and inability to isolate all the patients (7). Under such circumstances and despite the deficiencies in the healthcare system, younger patients also have difficulty receiving medical care, and it seems that the elderly do not have the chance to compete with them in receiving optimal care.",

The news constantly reminds us that the individuals aged less than 60 years are at a lower risk of the disease, and the mortality rate is higher in the elderly aged more than 60 years and those with comorbidities, which cause the inadvertent negligence of the value of the elderly. Such verbal mistreatment is evident in this difficult time (7, 8) . Although it may not matter to many, these statements leave a negative impact on the elderly, making them assuming that their life is not as important as other age groups (5). As is witnessed in many countries, this vulnerable population is treated as second-class citizens with no future. Some of the examples in this regard are the tests that have not become routine for everyone (especially for the elderly), post-acute care services, long-term facilities decreasing the admission rate of the elderly, death of the elderly residents of the nursing homes due to the abandonment of work by their caregivers, and due to the lack of equipment, intensive care unit beds, and ventilators as the elderly are detached from the ventilator to give younger individuals a chance to live (7, 9) .",

Although many guidelines indicate that the withdrawal of limited resources from severe or terminal patients in order to save the life of others is not an act of killing, such decision causes extreme psychological traumas in the elderly population (6, 11, 12) . The main issue in this regard is not the setting of priorities for receiving treatment, but rather the ambiguity about the implementation of such priorities in terms of morality and continuity as priorities must not deprive individuals of their right to live and survive (especially in vulnerable populations) based on organizational and therapeutic policies (13) .",
