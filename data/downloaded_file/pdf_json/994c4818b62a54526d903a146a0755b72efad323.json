Historical introductions had motives mostly related to agricultural practices (domestication, pest control) but also to more \"esthetic\" and political considerations, including entertainment, cultural exchanges and pet trade (Hughes 2003 ; Morales et al. 1995 ) . More recent introductions (twentieth to twenty-fi rst centuries) of mammals still originated from such motives (e.g., Delibes 1977 ) . Thus, the long history of introductions in the MB has resulted in serial faunal turnovers involving local extinctions of endemic fauna and serial establishments of introduced species, with new \"invaders\" regularly entering the native fauna (Cuttelod et al. 2008 ) . Assessing the impact of such introductions on the Mediterranean fauna is politically and economically crucial, but has proven a diffi cult task that may deserve a \"case-by-case\" (i.e., taxonomically and/or geographically) approach . By focusing on a group of Afro-Asian small Carnivores present in southern Europe, we intend to provide an exhaustive reassessment of their status that shall clarify their ecological impact in the MB.",

Middle-sized representatives (\" mesocarnivores \") such as those above-mentioned have been pinpointed for their deleterious impacts on the native communities of Carnivores and their preys (Bonesi and Palazon 2007 ) , notably in the context of endemic fauna (Medina et al. 2011 ). In the MB, mustelids (martens, weasels, badgers) seem to have been the earliest Carnivores transported on islands (Masseti 1995 ) . This pattern is congruent with the earliest molecular estimate of transportation of weasels ca. 10 kya (Lebarbenchon et al. 2010 ) . However, given their natural, circum-Mediterranean distribution at the Pleistocene period , it is unclear whether all the mustelids present on Mediterranean islands were introduced or natural dispersers (Masseti 1995 ) .",

            "text": "A contrario , the establishment of another lineage of small Carnivores including mongooses ( Herpestidae ) and genets ( Viverridae ) in Europe has traditionally been considered as more recent. Four species of herpestids and viverrids are or have recently been recorded from Mediterranean Europe and none of them has been considered native: the Indian grey mongoose Herpestes edwardsii , the small Indian mongoose H. auropunctatus , the Egyptian mongoose H. ichneumon , and the common genet Genetta genetta (Long 2003 ) . Those species are medium-sized predators naturally distributed in the tropical and subtropical zones of the Old World. They were supposedly introduced in Europe at various historical times, from the Middle Age to the twentieth century. Because such small Carnivores actively predate on species that can have a deleterious role in agriculture (e.g., rodents) or be directly harmful to humans (e.g., snakes), and also because they are commensal and can be kept as pets, they were good candidates to be spread through Mediterranean's trading and political networks. 1 Although the introductions of the Indian grey and small Indian mongooses in Europe are quite well documented, the introduction history of the Egyptian mongoose and the common genet has remained highly speculative. Importantly, it is unclear whether those four Carnivores have or had deleterious impacts on the native European fauna, and how their niches/ranges in the MB are characterized. Despite such lack of empirical data, local control operations-notably targeting mongooses in Portugal and Croatia-have been attempted with various levels of \"success\" (Hays and Conant 2007 ; Barun et al. 2011 ; Beja et al. 2009 ). In order to clarify their history of introduction and their status within the European fauna , I will (1) briefl y review the natural history of the Afro-Asian herpestids and viverrids present in the MB and their relationships with humans in their native ranges, (2) review their history of introduction, and for the lesser known species the speculations that have surrounded the factors promoting their possible introduction in Europe, (3) detail the recent enlightenments-and sometimes contradictions-brought by genetic analyses (mostly phylogeography) as to the dispersal histories of those small Carnivores, and (4) summarize their range dynamics and ecological interactions with the European fauna. In view of the reviewed evidence, I will then conclude on the expected \"invasiveness\" of those species in Europe and will eventually open a prospective on the strategies that could be adopted to improve our understanding of small Carnivores' establishments in the MB.",

Archaeological evidence from Harappan sites (western Indian subcontinent; fourth to fi rst millennia bc ) supports the idea that mongooses frequented human habitations, possibly as semidomesticated animals (Lodrick 1982 ) . The \" Brahmin and the Mongoose \" is a famous folktale from India that is another token of the good consideration that the mongoose benefi ts there. It describes the impulsive killing of a loyal mongoose that had protected a baby from snakes, and thus is a warning against hasty actions (Emeneau 1940 ) .

Representations of the species can be found on the walls of tombs and temples in Thebes and Saqqara as early as the period of the Old Kingdom (2800-2150 bc ). The Egyptian mongoose was associated to several deities including Atum, Re and Horus. It was also sacred to Mafdet, the goddess providing protection from snakebite, and mummifi ed Egyptian mongooses were discovered inside bronze statues of the lion-headed goddess Uto. A legend relates the defeat of the thunder snake Apophis by the mongoose as the surrogate of the god Letopolis, refl ecting again the representation of the species as a benefi cial snakekiller. In Ancient Egypt and later in the Arabic culture (as late as nineth century ad ), the Egyptian mongoose was believed to alter its size between day and night, becoming very small at night (as a shrew or a mouse) and being able to kill snakes by suddenly increasing its size if captured (Stuart 1988 ) . Depictions of mongooses hold by their tail or on a leash suggest that the species was tamed in Ancient Egypt, possibly as a household pet, biocontrol agent, or hunting animal. Egyptian mongooses were kept in temples as votive offerings until the Greco-Roman times. However, they seem not to have been domesticated or bred in captivity (Osborn and Osbornova 1998 ) .",

The supposed introductions of the Indian grey and the Egyptian mongooses in various parts of the world (Malaysia, Japan, Mauritius, Antilles Isl., Madagascar) are most probably confusions with other (Asian) mongooses, including H. auropunctatus (Gilchrist et al. 2009 ; Choudhury et al. 2013) . The history of introduction of the small Indian mongoose in Italy is relatively well documented. Probably in 1952, the owner of a hotel in San Felice Circeo (Central Italy) released a few mongooses-acquired from the Giardino Zoologico di Roma-in her park with the aim of removing adders. Those animals escaped during the second half of the 1950s, and a population established into nearby areas of the Circeo National Park . At the end of the 1970s, mongooses reached their maximum range, which covered ca. 15 km 2 from the whole Circeo promontory to most of the protected area south of Molella Bay (Carpaneto 1990 ; Angelici 2003 ) . The collection of a specimen of H. edwardsii from Capalbio (Tuscany), ca. 200 km northward of Circeo, shows that at least two events of introduction occurred in Italy at ca. 10 years of interval, probably from the same captive stock. The reasons for this second introduction remain unknown. However, a letter from 1966 written by the director of the Capalbio hunting estate quoted a negative advice provided by the Laboratorio di Zoologia Applicata alla Caccia (future Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale) about the introduction of mongooses to control populations of adders, reinforcing the idea that using these animals to control venomous snakes was rather widespread at that time. The Indian grey mongoose is now considered extinct in Italy (Angelici 2003 ) , a unique fate among the herpestids and viverrids introduced in Europe (see below).",

It was introduced to many islands in the Pacifi c and Indian Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, mostly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, to control rats and poisonous snakes in sugar cane fi elds (Lowe et al. 2000 ) . The introduction of H. auropunctatus in Europe is well documented. Seven males and four females purchased in India were released in 1910 on the island of Mljet (current Croatia), formerly known as the \" island of snakes .\" At that time, the Austro-Hungarian authorities had decided to introduce wild mongooses in order to exterminate the horned viper Vipera ammodytes from the island. Given the rapid decrease in the number of snakes and the growing numbers of mongooses on Mljet Isl., the species was soon introduced on nearby islands (Korcula, Peljesac, Brac) between 1921 and 1927. Afterwards, several attempts of introduction-with various levels of success-were planned onto a series of Adriatic islands but also in the mainland of former Yugoslavia (currently Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia) until the 1970s (Tvrtkovic and Krystufek 1990 ; Krystufek and Tvrtkovic 1992 ) . Interestingly, the historical record kept track of a transportation of ca. 100 mongooses from Mljet Isl. to Venezuela around 1926, thus suggesting that part of the small Indian mongooses introduced in the Caribbean Isl. originated from Europe (Tresic Pavicic 1936 ) .",

However, this scenario is somewhat contradicted by the discovery of an Egyptian mongoose remain in a Carthaginian site from the fi fth to fourth centuries bc in Sardinia (Campanella and Wilkens 2004 ) , evidencing the historical transportation of the species by an earlier civilization. Besides, it has long been said that there is no evidence for the domestication or taming of H. ichneumon by North African people during historical times (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 1813 ). As a matter of fact, traces of manipulation or taming as could be the case with tooth abrasion, presence of associated artifacts or intentional disposal practices, have never been observed on any of the archaeological remains found in Europe.",

This led authors to suggest an early introduction of the species through the political network between the Greek colonies and the Kingdom of Tartessos. According to Posidonius (fi rst century bc ), this \"weasel\" was used in southern Iberia as a bio-control agent against rabbit proliferation (Amigues 1999 ) . The common genet was also mentioned in a faunistic list from the Gallic site of Ambrussum (southern France) as associated with domestic furniture from the third century bc (Columeau 1979 ) .

To date, a single genetic analysis based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and including the four remaining specimens of the mongooses introduced in Italy has been conducted. It clearly confi rmed the Indian grey mongoose as the species having been introduced in Italy during the twentieth century and traced the introduced pool's origin to Pakistan or India, which is the core distribution of the species in its native range. The mtDNA diversity of Italian mongooses was null, thus suggesting a very limited number of founders (Gaubert and Zenatello 2009 ) .

The results of this study radically contradicted the established idea that the Egyptian mongoose was introduced in Europe. Instead, Gaubert et al. ( 2011 ) proposed a natural crossing of the Mediterranean Sea by H. ichneumon via the Strait of Gibraltar during the Middle Pleistocene, long before the earliest (Paleolithic) human exchanges between North Africa and Europe. The strong genetic differentiation between European and North African haplogroups, the signifi cant level of genetic diversity found in Europe, and the important phenotypic differences between European and North African mongooses all pointed to a scenario of long-term in situ evolution of European populations. These molecular results supported the hypothesis that natural dispersal across the Strait of Gibraltar was possible for nonfl ying vertebrates during the Pleistocene cyclical lowering of sea levels. The swimming abilities of the Egyptian mongoose make plausible a sweepstake migration using a partially emerged shoal such as the archipelago of Cape Spartel (where the mythic city of Atlantis was possibly located) that is now 56 to 200 m below sea level (Collina-Girard 2001 ) . The long-term stability of mongooses' effective population size in Europe was supported by various genetic indices and the remarkable correspondence between the limits of the proposed ice age refugium in southwestern Iberia (Hewitt 1996 ) and the distribution of suitable ecological conditions for the species (specifi cally, low rainfall and warm temperatures; Borralho et al. 1996 ) . Niche modelling approaches have since supplied independent evidence for the long-term stability (climatic niche conservatism) of the Egyptian mongoose in southwestern Iberia (Pape\u015f et al. 2015 ) .",

The combined evidence supported multiple introductions from North Africa into Europe, including the Balearic Isl. (with three distinct introduction events on Ibiza, Mallorca and later Cabrera), southwestern Iberia (corresponding to the Tartessian Kingdom's zone of infl uence), and possibly northeastern Spain and southwestern France (secondary introduction from Iberia for the latter). Those studies suggest that the common genet was intentionally introduced in southern Iberia at a time (<300 bc) antedating the Arab invasion, possibly via Phoenicians' commercial routes. Subsequent introduction in France, longterm genetic drift, and admixture between the Iberian and French pools likely shaped the species' genetic variation currently observed in continental Europe. The mtDNA-based demographic scenario of multiple, historical introductions of common genets in Europe followed by sudden population expansion is characteristic of populations at disequilibrium Gaubert et al. 2011 ) . Such scenario was supported by niche modelling analysis through the detection of a climatic niche shift in the northern European range of the species (Pape\u015f et al. 2015 ) . Altogether, these results suggest that an exceptional combination of factors including multiple introductions, local admixture, and ecological adaptation promoted the successful spread of the common genet in continental Europe.",

A survey conducted in summer 1984 failed to recover any evidence for the presence of the mongoose (Biondi 1985 ) . Although poorly documented, it is probable that the extinction process of H. edwardsii in Italy might have taken place quickly after the species reached its maximum range between 1978 and 1980 (Carpaneto 1990 ) , possibly due to harsh winters. Mongooses were seen wandering in villages close to the Circeo promontory, apparently searching for food and shelter . The species showed a tame, diurnal behavior, consuming tourists' leftovers and accepting direct feeding from humans. Its sudden extinction in Italy fi ts with crashes observed in populations with very restricted ranges within the 25 years following their time of introduction (Duncan and Forsyth 2006 ) . Because the mitochondrial diversity among Italian individuals was null, it is reasonable to conclude that a combination of deleterious factors including low genetic diversity, restricted range, and non-adaptation to western Palearctic winter conditions was likely responsible for the extinction of the species in Italy (Gaubert and Zenatello 2009 ) . Documentation of interspecifi c competition with native Carnivores is scarce, although a dominance of the Indian grey mongoose over polecats Mustela putorius was suggested during the years of mongooses' maximal expansion.

            "text": "In comparison with H. edwardsii , the small Indian mongoose shows a series of characteristics that may promote invasive success: (1) effi cient physiological mechanisms for dealing with hot and moderately cold environments; (2) aggressive behavior against direct competitors/predators such as domestic cats; and (3) wide range of deleterious pathogens, including rabies (Gaubert and Zenatello 2009 ) . The success of the small Indian mongoose as a biocontrol agent is questionable because the species is a generalist predator preying on other species than rodents and snakes (Hinton and Dunn 1967 ) . Reductions or extinctions of populations of birds, reptiles, and amphibians caused by H. auropunctatus have been reported on islands worldwide, although there is controversy over whether the small Indian mongoose has genuinely been the main culprit (Lewis et al. 2011 ; Hays and Conant 2007 ) . A secondary aspect of the deleterious impact of the species resides in its role of main reservoir for viruses (e.g., rabies) and parasites (e.g., Weil's disease) impacting wildlife and humans in several parts of the Caribbean (Hatcher et al. 2012 ; Everard and Everard 1992 ) . This latter point remains undocumented in Europe. In Croatia , the species is accused of having a deleterious impact on wild fowl, poultry and several cultivars, and so is subject to extermination campaigns led by hunting federations (Tvrtkovic and Krystufek 1990 ) . It has also been speculated that the species could have \" catastrophic consequences \" on the Balkan continental herpetofauna (\u0106irovi\u0107 et al. 2011 ). However, a study conducted on Korcula Isl. evidenced a low consumption of reptiles and amphibians by the small Indian mongoose, and in comparison a high consumption of small mammals, birds, arthropods and plants (Cavallini and Serafi ni 1995 ) . The minor representation of the herpetofauna in the mongoose's diet is actually a general trend throughout its introduced range ( Table 1 in Hays and Conant 2007 ) . On the other hand, it was observed that reptiles and amphibians were generally rare or absent from the islands occupied by the species whereas they were common on the mongoose-free island of Brac (Barun et al. 2010 ) . Unfortunately, predation of the native herpetofauna by other invasive species such as the black rat and the domestic cat has not been evaluated.",

The reasons for its extinction are unknown, but were probably linked to its artifi cial maintenance as a semi-domestic animal or to the progressive disappearance of such habitat (Osborn and Osbornova 1998 ) . In Europe, suitability models predicted the expansion of the species in southern and central Spain in areas with a high rabbit abundance, thus foreseeing the existence of large regions of potential confl ict with hunting interests (Recio and Virgos 2010 ) . Climatic niche modelling outputs were less conservative and predicted most of the Iberian Peninsula as potentially suitable for the Egyptian mongoose (Pape\u015f et al. 2015 ) . Because there is no signifi cant change in the composition of the Carnivore community at the northern fringe of the European range of the species (Wilson & Mittermeier, 2009 ) , interspecifi c competition cannot be considered a limiting factor. In addition, release from biotic/historical constraints, including h abitat disruption and climate warming , could lead to local or temporary range expansion of the Egyptian mongoose, as refl ected by its recent spread into northern Portugal related to rural depopulation (Barros 2009 ). Whether this current trend can be assimilated to a colonization front and whether the recent records of the species in northwestern Spain (Balmori and Carbonell 2012 ) refl ect a genuine increase of northern dispersals will have to be evaluated.",

In case of competition with other Carnivores, the Egyptian mongoose may modify its realized niche by having more diurnal activities (Santos et al. 2007 ) and can shift its microhabitat use (e.g., by preferentially using thicker scrubland) to prevent deadly encounters with dominant species such as the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus (Viota et al. 2012 ) . So far, the role of H. ichneumon in carrying zoonotic diseases seems very limited. In Europe, rabies spillover infection from red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes ) was not detected (M\u00fcller et al. 2015 ) . In Portugal, a high prevalence of parvovirus DNA was detected in mongooses (58 %), potentially carrying a risk to susceptible populations at the wildlife-domestic interface and to threatened species of sympatric Carnivores (Duarte et al. 2013 ) .",
