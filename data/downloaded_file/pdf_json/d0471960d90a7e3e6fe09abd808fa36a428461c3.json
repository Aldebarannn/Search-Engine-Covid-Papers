These devices can generate large amounts of multimodal data daily that include physiological waveform signals (arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiration), patient alarm messages, numeric vitals data, etc. In order to provide opportunities for increasingly improved patient care, it is necessary to develop an effective data acquisition and analysis system that can assist clinicians and provide decision support at the patient bedside. Previous research has discussed various data collection methods, but a comprehensive solution for bedside data acquisition to analysis has not been achieved. In this paper, we proposed a multimodal data acquisition and analysis system called INSMA, with the ability to acquire, store, process, and visualize multiple types of data from the Philips IntelliVue patient monitor. We also discuss how the acquired data can be used for patient state tracking. INSMA is being tested in the",

In extreme situations, like the current COVID-19 pandemic, ICUs are essential for treating critically ill coronavirus patients. Given the high stakes involved, timely and effective care is paramount, and this requires continuous patient surveillance using sophisticated monitoring equipment. As a result, ICUs are complex, data-intensive environments and dozens of systemic parameters are monitored, including heart rate, respiration, arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, end tidal CO2 concentration, etc. Enormous volumes of multimodal physiological data are generated including physiological waveform signals, patient monitoring alarm messages, and numerics and if acquired, synchronized and analyzed, this data can been effectively used to support clinical decision-making at the bedside [10, 18] .",

Understanding the dynamics of critical illness requires precisely time-stamped physiologic data (sampled frequently enough to accurately recreate the detail of physiologic waveforms) integrated with clinical context, but this will produce an overwhelming amount of data-far too much to be routinely reviewed manually. It is thus necessary to develop a data acquisition system that facilitates the access and review of historical data for medical personnel. The acquired data needs to be synchronized across disparate devices, archived, analyzed and presented to clinical personnel in a manner that supports clinical decision-making at the patient bedside. Previous work includes, for example: Matam and Duncan adopt the real-time data recording system used for F1 race cars to acquire and analyze data from bedside monitors in the pediatric intensive care unit [6] . This system supports the storage and review of electrocardiogram (ECG) data retrospectively. Raimond et al. developed a platform called \"WaveformECG\" that provides interactive analysis, visualization and annotation of ECG signals [7] . Alexander et al. developed an alarm data collection framework to acquire all alarms generated from Philips IntelliVue MP70 patient monitors installed in each ICU room with the objective of reducing false alarms by leveraging annotations provided by clinicians [4] . Hyung and Chul introduced a physiological data acquisition and visualization program \"Vital Recorder\" with a user-friendly interface similar to that of a video-editing program for anesthesia information management, where Physiological data can be manipulated like editing video clips [8] .",

We have been working on building the Integrated Medical Environment (tIME) [10] to address this critical opportunity and in this paper, we discuss an integrated system (INSMA) that supports multimodal data acquisition, parsing, real-time data analysis and visualization in the ICU. In the current implementation, INSMA acquires data from the Philips IntelliVue patient monitor, and has the ability to store and review the multimodal data acquired either in real-time or on request. The system has been tested in the ICU at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, for multimodal data analysis and patient state tracking.",

Goldstein et al. proposed and developed a physiologic data acquisition system that could capture and archive parametric data, but the annotation of important clinical events such as changes in a patient's condition or timing of drug administration, was limited [22] . Kool et al. reported that they collected numerical data at five-second intervals from the Datex Ohmeda S/5 TM monitoring system using their own information management system [14] . Liu et al.

Lee and Jung developed an anaesthesia information management system (AIMS) for the acquisition of high-quality vital signal data (Vital Recorder) to support research [8] . Physiological data of surgical patients were collected from 10 operating rooms by Vital Recorder through the patient monitor, anaesthesia machine and bispectral index monitor. Winslow et al. proposed a platform called WaveformECG for visualizing, annotating, and analyzing ECG data [7] .

The specific types of data to be acquired can be chosen by the users according to their needs through the \"Data Type Selector\" and \"Physiological Signal Selector\". The data transport rate can also be set by the \"Serial Port Selector\". Once the raw data has been acquired from the monitor, the Data Parsing Module will process, parse and transform the data into a time-series using the physiological identifiers or codes provided by the monitor. The Data Visualization Module will display the graphs for the parsed time-series results. It can plot both real-time signals and historical data given a time range. All three modules are developed using MFC and C/C++, so that they all run in the same operating environment and use compatible data formats, and therefore provide a complete solution for data acquisition, parsing and visualization. The details of these modules are discussed in next sections. ",

Advances in informatics, whether through data acquisition, physiologic alarm detection, or signal analysis and visualization for decision support have the potential to markedly improve patient treatment in ICUs. Clinical monitors have the ability to collect and visualize important numerics or waveforms, but more work is needed to interface to the monitors and acquire and synchronize multimodal physiological data across a diverse set of clinical devices. Patient monitors offer the opportunity to acquire a number of different physiological signals in a single device, but in certain cases there are other monitors and devices whose data is critical to patient care, but do not interface to the patient monitor. The tIME framework that we are developing is directly addressing this unmet clinical need. An integrated solution for multimodal data acquisition, parsing and visualization in the ICU (INSMA) presented in this paper is an important first step in achieving this overall vision [20] . Particularly in the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit, there are a variety of different devices that provide valuable information for patient care that do not interface directly to a patient monitor including EEG signal data, real-time tissue blood flow (perfusion) data, and advanced hemodynamic data monitoring (e.g. continuous cardiac output) that are cornerstones in the management of critically ill patients. There are options, for example, with Nihon-Kohden EEG acquisition systems to collect patient vitals (similar to a bedside patient monitor) as well as interface to specialized devices such as for hemodynamic monitoring. Simultaneous acquisition of data from Philips patient monitors and Nihon-Kohden EEG systems in the ICU was done to augment data provided in the MIMIC study [21] . The objective of data acquisition was to stream real-time data from both monitors for archiving in a single biorepository. This provides valuable data for research, but the intent of tIME is to stream data for real-time patient care at the bedside. INSMA is an important first step, and we have also developed data techniques for synchronizing data acquisition from a variety of different ICU devices as a core technology for future implementations of tIME in the ICU. We have also demonstrated that patient data acquired from the patient monitor can be used for patient state tracking. The prototype system we developed was optimized to identify the type of dynamics observed in cardiac (ECG or blood pressure) beat-to-beat time-series data collected from ICU patients. The prototype system has been tested using ICU patient data from ECG to understand how variability in the heartbeat time-series can be used to dynamically track patient state [19] .",

Using a communication interface protocol, data from the Philips IntelliVue Patient Monitor MP70 can be transferred via the Local Area Network (LAN) Interface or Medical Information Bus (MIB/RS232) Interface to an external computer. For the LAN interface, the transport protocol is the standard UDP/IP protocol. For the MIB/RS232 interface, two transport protocols are supported: a fixed baudrate protocol at 19200 or 115200 baud and a protocol with baudrate negotiation (Auto Speed). INSMA can connect and acquire data using either the UDP/IP/LAN protocol/interface or the MIB/RS232 protocol/interface. The Fixed Baudrate Protocol provides a transport protocol with minimal overhead and complexity, so we describe how INSMA uses the Fixed Baudrate Protocol through the MIB/RS232 interface. The Fixed",

We then interpret the multimodal data in the User Data field.For the numeric data, we need to interpret the physiological parameters of Numerics Observed Value and Compound Numerics Observed Value. The Numerics Observed Value attribute represents the measured value, along with state and identification data. Each observed value of numeric data has the same data structure. The Compound NumericsObserved Value attribute represents multiple measured values contained in one Numeric object, along with state and identification data. For example, a blood pressure measurement can include systolic, diastolic and mean values in a single Numeric object.The Alarm object represents the overall device alert condition and contains the global status and a list of active patient alarms. There are two groups of alarms available in the IntelliVue monitor: the active Technical Alarm (T-Alarm) and the active Patient Alarm (P-Alarm). T-Alarm messages indicate that the monitor cannot measure or detect alarm conditions reliably. P-Alarm indicates a relevant deviation from a normal clinical state of patient. It can be a high priority alarm signal such as a potentially life-threatening situation (for example, asystole), or a lower priority alarm signal like a respiration alarm limit violation. T-Alarm and P-Alarm both have the same alarm data structure, including the alarm source, code, type, state, etc.",

Progressive amounts of white noise are added to the time-series and then the time-series are integrated to generate their brown noise equivalent and to generate a fingerprint database of synthetic time-series that span multifractal time-series dynamics from white noise and brown noise. The fingerprint database is then processed using any algorithm that quantifies multiscale variability dynamics (e.g. Multi-Scale Entropy in our application), and the curated database is divided into classes based on how generated profiles clustered. Next, a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) is trained on the curated database to classify the MSE profiles according to the specified classes.
