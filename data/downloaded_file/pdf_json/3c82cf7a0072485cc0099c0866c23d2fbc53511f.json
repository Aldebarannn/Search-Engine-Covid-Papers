Results. Among 199 COVID-19 patients, 76 were diabetic and 123 were nondiabetic. Compared with nondiabetics, patients with diabetes had an older age, high levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), D-dimer, white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and total bilirubin (TBIL), lower levels of lymphocyte, albumin and oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ), and higher mortality (P < 0:05). The two groups showed no difference in clinical symptoms. Diabetes, higher level of D-dimer at admission, and lymphocyte count less than 0:6 \u00d7 10 9 /L at admission were associated with increasing odds of death.

The mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with diabetes was significantly higher than those without diabetes.

Lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature of critically ill patients with COVID-19 because targeted invasion by SARS-CoV viral particles damages the cytoplasmic component of the lymphocyte and causes its destruction [17] . Hence, we speculate that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induces lymphocytopenia in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
