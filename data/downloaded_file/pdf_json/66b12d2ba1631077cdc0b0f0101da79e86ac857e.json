Methods Recent findings about SARS-CoV-2 virus and the COVID-19 infection it causes are reviewed. In addition to international databases and in the absence of hard scientific data, literature search included reports published online from scientific societies and other institutions. Results The role of anosmia as a COVID-19-related symptom is presented. Further, considerations about steroid administration in ENT-related conditions are also discussed. Due to the close work with mucosa surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract, otolaryngologists and surrounding staff are considered high risk for coronavirus transmission. Hence, staff protection measures for ENT examinations, surgeries and other procedures during COVID-19 pandemic are recommended. Conclusion Knowledge and evidence about the impact of COVID-19 infection on otolaryngology clinical practice are accumulating rapidly.

SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Infected respiratory droplets enter the human body through the nose and mouth. Conjunctiva is also considered to be a potential entrance point, although clear data proving this are not sufficient. Contact transmission by hands occurs through surfaces on which the virus is deposited. Aerosol transmission of the virus is plausible as well; however, doubtful evidence of this is still lacking.

In April 2020, WHO added loss of smell and taste to the official lists of COVID-19 symptoms [11] . In particular, anosmia rates in SARS-COV-2 positive patients vary significantly among studies and are in the order of 30-70%, while in some of the patients anosmia may be the only present symptom [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . For example, new data arrive from a recently conducted European multicenter study in which patients with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 infection completed olfactory and gustatory questionnaires. The results showed that 85.6% and 88.0% of patients reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively. Olfactory dysfunction (OD) appeared before the other symptoms in 11.8% of cases, whereas the early olfactory recovery rate was 44.0% [17] . In addition, results from the first 237 entries of the COVID-19 Anosmia Reporting Tool for Clinicians, developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, revealed that anosmia was noted in 73% of patients prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and was the initial symptom in 26.6% [18] . There is a very high heteterogeneity among studies, with proportions ranging from 5 to 98% [16] . Differences in clinical work-up, specific regional patient characteristics or viral strains might be possible explanations for these rate variations [15] . The COVID-19-related anosmia is reported to be different from the well-known post-viral loss of smell, which follows rhinitis or other upper respiratory tract infections.
