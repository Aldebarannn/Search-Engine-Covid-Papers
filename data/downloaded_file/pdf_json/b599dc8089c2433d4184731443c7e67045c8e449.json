Current healthcare systems are focused on providing prevention, screening, and finding vaccine and treatment for the infection and thus ensuring access to mental healthcare should also be part of the continuity of treatment. Psychological distress in the general population has been reported during COVID-19 quarantine (Rana, Mukhtar and Mukhtar, 2020) . However, disasters disproportionally affect vulnerable populations and individuals with serious mental illness could confer a worst prognosis from COVID-19 and the consequential social distancing measures as well. Residential instability, homelessness, lack of family and social support, lockdown and social distancing can raise the risk of infection and make it harder for assessment and management of those who would be infected from population with serious mental illness (Lewis, 2020; Tsai and Wilson, 2020; Mukhtar, 2020b) . Limited social networking and social distancing may limit opportunities to obtain support from friends and family members' poses more adverse threats to individuals with mental illness. These factors may lead to elevated mental health issues and could have worst prognosis in this population. Medical psychiatric staff faces significant psychological pressure during this period to manage the possibility of shortage of medication, beds, and supplies, and executing the protection policies (to recognize the risk of infection and actively avoid related activities) in isolated and locked wards.",
