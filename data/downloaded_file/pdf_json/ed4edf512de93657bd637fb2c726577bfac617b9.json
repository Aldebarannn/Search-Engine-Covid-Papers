Virtually all major worldwide GISAID clades (Shu and McCauley, 2017) are represented in OR genomes, with the largest number in GH and G as well as sizable clusters in S and V-clades. Of note the former major clades have highest representation in Europe, but were also observed as the dominant clades in the spread to South America, Africa and Canada. The S-clade exhibits highest representation in Asia and V-clade represents an early introduction of the virus into Italy and Europe from China (Giovanetti et al., 2020) . Genomic variation in these isolates spanned the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with notable hotspots in ORF1A, ORF3A and Spike (Figure 1B) , and variant classes were predominantly missense or synonymous ( Figure 1C) . A cohort of isolates mapped to S-clade with high similarity to the original WA isolate (one of the earliest introduction events in the United States (Holshue et al., 2020) ) as well as other early WA-specific sequences (Bedford et al., 2020) . Given the extent of frequent travel between OR and WA, it is perhaps unsurprising that a large number of early isolates bear similarity to WA SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Overall, we observed a shift in clade representation over time, with the early cases dominated primarily by L-, S-and V-clades and later cases predominated by the G-clades (Figure 2A) .

We note that despite the high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G in our study cohort, only one of twelve deceased patients had a D614G-positive infection (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Despite this, D614G genotype did not well differentiate between overall admission status in the cohort. In contrast, as expected we see a strong differentiation between the ages of Outpatient vs ACU admitted patients ( = 3.72 -10 Mann-Whitney U Test), along with current or former smoking status ( = 7.75 -3 G-Test). Comorbidities were the strongest indicator of hospital admission, with all but asthma having a \u2264 1.79 -3 (G-Test).

We then asked whether SARS-CoV-2 D614G or other genotypes exhibited utility in predicting hospital admission due to COVID-19. We developed a panel of classifiers based on different algorithmic approaches (logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM)). For this we divided the sequenced patients into two populations based on admitted versus outpatient. Classifiers were then built based on patient demographics and prior comorbidities alone, demographics plus viral titer in the swab specimen (RT-PCR Ct value), and finally demographics plus viral titer plus D614G genotype. The results for these models based using LR, RF and SVM are detailed in Figure 6 below. Of note, classification of inpatient versus outpatient was highly accurate based on patient demographics alone using all three approaches, with both the RF and SVM achieving 88% accuracy. Notably, adding viral titer and D614G genotype to the model boosted the accuracy to over 90% for the RF approach, the best performing classifier out of all models tested.
