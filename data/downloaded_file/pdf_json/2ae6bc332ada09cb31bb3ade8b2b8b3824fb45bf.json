In this study they examined a large US cohort derived from the Department of Defense healthcare system and a large UK cohort from general practice registries. This allowed them to compare 8695 MS cases in the US with 86,934 in the general population matched for age, sex and geography. Similarly, they contrasted 6932 MS cases from the UK to 68,526 in the general population. People with MS from the US and UK had significantly higher rates of any transmissible disease at 76% and 25% respectively. Infections leading to hospitalization were more than doubled in both cohorts. All types of infection were increased: viral, fungal, pneumonia and influenza but also opportunistic ones. The infection rate seemed to be higher in the US than in the UK. This could be due to differences in data collection for each cohort, but the authors also queried if this is because of prescription of immunosuppressive medication being higher in the US than in the UK. Unfortunately, in the UK cohort DMTs were not recorded. Therefore, they compared patients on monoclonal antibody treatment to all other cases in the US cohort and found that the risk of any infection was actually lower in the cohort treated with monocloncal antibodies compared to the remaining cohort, but infections leading to hospitalization seemed to occur more frequently in the cohort on monocloncal antibodies.",

            "text": "These findings are similar to another recent study 2 which based their analysis on a nationwide data collection on influenza infections in Norway: infection related hospitalizations were 3-5 times higher in people with MS than the general public. The finding that MS patients are more likely to be hospitalized is not that surprising given that any infection, especially when fever occurs, can lead to a worsening of preexisting MS symptoms. So, frequency of hospital admissions is not necessarily giving us the answer to whether MS itself or its treatment is predisposing patients to infections. Interestingly, the rate of community acquired pneumonia is 3.6 times higher in MS than the general population 3 -higher than in patients with diabetes mellitus, stroke and even patients on immunosuppressive therapies! A study from British Columbia examined 6793 MS cases of which 1716 were exposed to DMTs 4 . There was no difference in the risk of infection between not taking DMT and being on injectable treatment like beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Oral DMTs and natalizumab increased by 50% the risk of infection related physician claims but not hospitalizations; hospitalization risk correlated better with level of disability. This study was unable to outline which treatment is most risky but a Swedish registry study had much more detailed data on their patients 5 and was able to compare 6421 MS patients to 42 645 matched cases from the general population. 3260 of these MS patients were on rituximab, 1588 on natalizumab, 1535 on fingolimod and 2217 on injectables. While the study from British Columbia could not find any significant difference in infection risk between people on no treatment and those on immune modulators like beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate, this Swedish cohort had an incidence ratio of any infection of 8.9 in MS cases versus 5.2 in the general population. Infections occurred almost twice as often in people with MS than in the general population. 11% of the general population took any sick leave in the preceding year, 23% of patients on injectables and 30% of patients on rituximab, fingolimod or natalizumab. Interestingly, after adjusting for clinical parameters the higher rate of any infections only remained significant for rituximab.",

The most commonly treated infection by MS specialists is not herpes (simplex or zoster), whose incidence is increased with some of the DMTs, but rather urinary tract infection. This results from bladder dysfunction which is extremely common in MS and often not appropriately treated. The other more prevalent infection is aspiration pneumonia. Again, many of our patients suffer from swallowing difficulties. A symptom that often escapes the attention of both doctor and patient.",

It is not clear yet whether patients with MS are more likely to get infected with coronavirus although early data from Italian, Swedish and French registries are not supportive of this claim (https://iwims.world/iwims-global-scientific-meetings).

Could the apparent higher incidence of infection in MS be inflated by the presence of prior relapse (suspected or not) which would then promote infection. Furthermore, as mentioned above, patient vigilance is likely increased in MS whether or not DMTs are being administered. Thus, intercurrent infection will be detected more frequently due to heightened awareness. Although the authors do allude to the possibility of selective recall bias it is unclear whether both of these important variables have been taken into account sufficiently in these studies.",
