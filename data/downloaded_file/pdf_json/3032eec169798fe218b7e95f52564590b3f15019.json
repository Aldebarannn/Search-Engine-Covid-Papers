An interconnected field and predecessor of knowledge visualisation is information visualisation and both these fields are utilising our natural abilities to successfully process visual representations. Although both these fields make use of our natural visual abilities, the way of utilising these abilities differ in both fields: Information visualisation intends to examine a large amount of abstract data to obtain new perceptions or to make the data more approachable. Knowledge visualisation, on the other hand, intends to enhance the transfer and creation of knowledge amongst people by providing a richer approach to communicate what they know.

Tacit knowledge, as a dimension of implicit knowledge, is personal and contextspecific, and therefore hard to communicate and formalise [21] . In order to act on information, a person should internalise the information and achieve this by progressing through knowledge conversion processes namely socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation [21] . Socialisation ensures that knowledge is acquired, after which externalisation enables students to express their tacit knowledge (mental models and know-how).

Two elements specifically pointed to the target audience of the knowledge visualisation namely, need and engagement. Audience need indicates key considerations relevant to the target audience such as an individual or a team, while audience engagement points to the audienceknowledge visualisation interaction with specific reference to how the knowledge visualisation enhance and facilitate learning engagement through interaction and experience. The focus of graphical excellence is on usability of the visualisation and ensuring that irrelevant items or decoration do not distract the target audience from the content of the topic. Essence refers to the identification and utilisation of the essentials, as well as their relationships, from a body of knowledge identified for visualisation, while accessibility indicates the relationship the target audience holds with the knowledge subject area, namely ensure that the level of abstraction is aligned to the target audience's prior knowledge of the particular knowledge subject area. The minimisation of the number of concepts in each level of knowledge visualisation points to the simplicity element, and intelligibility focuses on the objective that the knowledge visualisation should not carry ambiguity and that it is easy to understand. Uniformity of visual elements such as colour, symbols, shapes, etc. should be the same for the same kinds of information. Context is about presenting both the detail required for the knowledge visualisation, as well as the overview of where the detailed portion fits in. Context in an organisation highlights the combination of internal and external factors relevant to the organisation that may impact its products, services, business models, operating model, etc. Cohesion is the principle of working together and in the context of knowledge visualisation, it implies that the relationship among knowledge concepts, must be shown clearly. The explanatory power element ensures that knowledge visualisation has both explanatory and descriptive value. Descriptive value gives details and describes the knowledge that the target audience needs to understand, while explanatory value gives the reasons for it. In the organisational context, its application is closely related to whether knowledge recall is required, whether new insights are shared or whether existing knowledge is elaborated upon. By associating knowledge visualisation with familiar real world images, the target audience is enabled to recognise and interpret visuals rather than to have to remember and recall meaning. The legend element provides the information needed for the knowledge visualisation to make sense and assists in explaining meaning and interpretation. The process of transferring knowledge from one part of the organisation to another by organising, creating, capturing or distributing knowledge and ensuring it is available for future users, depicts the knowledge transfer cognitive process elements. The last element, visual integrity, points to the principle that the knowledge visualisation should have uncompromising adherence to underlying knowledge and should not create a false impression or interpretation of that knowledge.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Research Approach"}, {"text": "The purpose of the 15 knowledge visualisation elements that were extracted is to guide organisations on how to approach their knowledge visualisations in order to improve the transfer and sharing of knowledge in the organisation.
