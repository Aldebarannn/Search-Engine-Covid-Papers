Henry et al. pooled data of 4 different studies, totaling 347 patients, 3 and found a very modest difference of eosinophil count in COVID-19 patients with severe illness compared to those with milder disease (weighted mean difference (WMD), -0.01\u00d710 9 /L; 95% confidence interval (95%CI), -0.02 to -0.0\u00d710 9 /L), reporting also a high heterogeneity (I 2 , 74.4%).",

Roca et al reported a mean difference of around 0.009\u00d710 9 /L in the eosinophil count between COVID-19 patients who died and those who survived, and such difference was found to be even lower in COVID-19 patients with severe illness than in those with milder disease (i.e., 0.006\u00d710 9 /L). 1 Beside the fact that both these values were found to be only marginally significant (i.e., p=0.032 and p=0.049, respectively), the differences remain largely comprised within the between-subject biologic variation of the eosinophil count, https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/qjm which is as high as 76%. 5 Moreover, although the instrument used for obtaining the eosinophil count in patients with COVID-19 has not been clearly described by Roca et al, 1 the analytical goal of this parameter has been set at 26% 6 a threshold which almost overlaps with the differences reported by Roca et al in their study, 1 and which would hence make the significance of their data clinically ambiguous.",

Until the functional sensitivity and the analytical imprecision of the modern hematological analyzers will be improved, relying on the eosinophil count for therapeutic management of COVID-19 would hence remain largely unwarranted.",
