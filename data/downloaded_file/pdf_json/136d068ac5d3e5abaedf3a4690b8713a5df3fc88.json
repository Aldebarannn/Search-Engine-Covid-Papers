            "text": "Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a drastic reduction in surgical activity in order to respond to the influx of hospital patients and to protect uninfected patients by avoiding hospitalization. However, little is known about the risk of infection during hospitalization or its consequences. The aim of this work was to report a series of patients hospitalized on digestive surgery services who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 virus. Methods: This is a non-interventional retrospective study carried out within three departments of digestive surgery. The clinical, biological and radiological data of the patients who developed a nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2 were collected from the computerized medical record. Results: From March 1, 2020 to April 5, 2020, among 305 patients admitted to digestive surgery services, 15 (4.9%) developed evident nosocomial infection with SARS-Cov-2. There were nine men and six women, with a median age of 62 years (35-68 years). All patients had comorbidities. The reasons for hospitalization were: surgical treatment of cancer (n = 5), complex emergencies (n = 5), treatment of complications linked to cancer or its treatment (n = 3), gastroplasty (n = 1), and stoma closure (n = 1). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-Cov-2 infection was 34 days (5-61 days). In 12 patients (80%), the diagnosis was made after a hospital stay of more than 14 days (15-63 days). At the end of the follow-up, two patients had died, seven were hospitalized with two of them on respiratory assistance, and six patients were discharged post-hospitalization. Conclusions: The risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection during hospitalization or following digestive surgery is a real and potentially serious risk. Measures are necessary to minimize this risk in order to return to safe surgical activity.",

It now affects the entire population of France and impacts the entire French health system. The situation is unprecedented and calls into question the modes of care as well as the timing of interventions on surgical services, at a time when all the hospital means having been re-deployed towards the medical management of virus-infected patients. We very quickly saw hospitals transform into patient care centers for COVID-19 positive patients (COVID-19 +) that limited access to care for uninfected (COVID-19-) patients.",

These changes were necessary due to the extensive spread of the virus and the massive hospitalizations of infected patients. Measures within health care facilities to protect staff and hospitalized patients were taken. However, despite these measures, the risk of contracting the virus during hospitalization does not appear to be negligible and each hospitalization of a patient considered to be COVID-19-may expose him to infection with SARS-Cov-2.",

In addition, it is known that SARS-Cov-2 infection can be either asymptomatic or symptomatic, which means that there could be more than seven ''contact caregivers''. Finally, a detailed analysis of the ''contact caregivers'' is made very difficult by the very complex course of care of these patients. In fact, the majority developed complications that required admission to the ICU, and numerous imaging or interventional radiology examinations. A final possible mechanism is linked to the movement of patients within the hospital at the start of the epidemic. In fact, at two of the centers, digestive surgery patients were grouped together without being moved to premises with patients from other specialties who were considered to be COVID-19-. In the third center, all digestive surgery patients who were COVID-19-were moved in order to free up premises and staff to create dedicated areas for the hospitalization of COVID-19+ patients. In the absence of systematic screening of patients and caregivers, this could generate contamination [3] .",

SARS-Cov-2 infection in a patient hospitalized on a surgical service involves both individual risk and a collective risk. Individually, SARS-Cov-2 infection puts the surgical patient at risk due to the risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. We might assume that this risk is increased in a malnourished patient, who is immunocompromised, by the underlying pathology, or by the surgical procedure whose complications could require further invasive gestures. Liang et al. reported that infection was more severe (severity defined by ICU admission or death) in cancer patients (seven [39%] of 18 patients vs. 124 [8%] of 1572 patients; Fisher's exact: P = 0.0003) [4] . However, this series was made up of relatively few patients, suffering mainly (28%) from bronchopulmonary cancer, and therefore likely to have pre-existing deterioration of their respiratory function. The ''cancer'' and ''non-cancer'' groups were not comparable: the 18 patients were significantly older [median 63.1 years (SD 12.1) vs. 48.7 years (2,16)], and had a higher rate of smoking [4 (22%) of 18 patients vs. 107 (7%) of 1572 patients]; these two factors are prognostic factors for severe disease. In addition, among the 18 patients, only one patient had actually undergone surgery (adrenal), while the remainder of the patients were undergoing chemotherapy. Another series of 1,524 cancer patients by Yu et al. reported a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (OR, 2.31; 95%CI, 1.89-3.02).",

Strict compliance with aseptic techniques and nosocomial infection prevention measures should also be universal to avoid transmitting SARS-Cov-2 from an undiagnosed carrier patient [9] . This series, in which all the patients had a positive PCR proving the SARS-Cov-2 contagion, is however limited by the small number of patients (n = 15), and thus, the heterogeneity of the pathologies. Analysis suggests that SARS-Cov-2 infection appears preferentially in patients with severe co-morbidities and/or who are admitted for major digestive pathologies. The long hospital stay (mean: 34 days, range 5-61 days) increased the risk of contamination. Likewise, the incubation period of COVID-19 was heterogeneous, varying from two to 14 days [7] . The persistence of viral RNA for up to 37 days [10] , and the timing of preventive measures application make it impossible to formally confirm the nosocomial nature of SARS-Cov-2 infection in all cases diagnosed.",
