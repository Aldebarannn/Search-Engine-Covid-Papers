            "text": "Several words of caution are in place. First, we cannot rule out that recall bias-due to the retrospective nature of the baseline assessment-partially explained the substantial improvement in falls and other patient-reported outcomes throughout the intervention period, although this unlikely to fully explain the full effect size that we observed. Second, we also cannot rule out regression to the mean -due to the initial high scores of falls indicating a tendency towards change -as an explanation of the observed improvements. Third, the intervention was rather intensive (13 telephone contacts during three months), so the cost-effectiveness remains to be demonstrated. Theoretically, preventing major complications such as hip fractures could cover the costs of telenursing, but this needs to be studied. Also, simply being able to speak so regularly to a trusted person might have therapeutic effects in its own right, regardless of any PD-specific management advice or the level of experience of the professional doing the telephone interviews.",

Our case report addresses exactly that gap in knowledge. We acknowledge that single case observations can never provide definitive proof about causation, but importantly, carefully established observations in single patients are all but lack of evidence -they represent a low grade of evidence, and as such serve as catalyst to stimulate further research [12] .",

Importantly, we believe that telenursing can only unfold its full potential when it does not stand on its own, but when it is delivered as an integral component of an overall, multidisciplinary and multifaceted package of chronic care delivery. In this context, telenurses have an integrating role across all layers of healthcare ensuring collaboration with and between health care providers, while at the same time reducing the case load of HCPs We feel that initial results presented here should encourage further systematic research into the potential merits of telenursing services for patients with PD or other complex and chronic health conditions. In particular, the marked reduction in number of falls, if confirmed and replicated, would have a substantial positive impact on patients' QoL as well as on the cost of healthcare services for PD patients. Reductions in anxiety could potentially also lead to fewer outpatient visits to the medical specialist, thus further contributing to cost-effectiveness. We believe that telenursing services could potentially promote health among all patients with PD, regardless of disease stage and severity. Telenursing is still relatively in its infancy, but due to the current COVID-19 crisis it is increasingly recognized as a potentially cost-effective alternative to in-person visits [13] . In the United States, for instance, almost all states are working on new regulations to make telemedicine service more available and to ensure reimbursement [14] . Adoption of reimbursement models beyond the corona crisis, however, still need to be discussed. Telenursing could play a key role for health promotion and benefits especially those who experience immobility due to disease progression or transportation barriers and those living in remote areas with a limited number of available PD specialists. Further large-scale evaluations which include a diverse sample of persons with PD with a range of disease severity, and a control group are now warranted to clarify the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and scaling potential of telenursing interventions. Figure 1 in S1 displays the core elements of the telenursing service. Figure 2 in S2 displays the severity score on sub-questions on the Non-Motor Symptom Scale Score (NMSS) with 0 = no symptoms, 1= mild symptoms present but causes little distress, 2 = moderate symptoms causing some distress or disturbance to patient, 3 = severe symptoms with being major source of distress or disturbance to patient.

            "text": "year-old woman had been diagnosed with PD in 1996, at the age of 44. Symptom progression was controlled satisfactorily by pharmacotherapy until 2004. In 2005 she underwent bilateral Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation, with complete regression of motor complications for almost 5 years. Since 2010, moderate fluctuations and dyskinesias reappeared but the most disabling emerging symptom was freezing of gait (FOG), present both in ON and OFF phases. This symptom caused multiple falls, which led to traumatic injuries on three occasions (cracked ribs, knee bruising and abrasions). Moreover, during the previous 9 months, she started to experience hallucinations. The cognitive function was normal (MMSE 30/30). The patient joined a telenursing service (ParkinsonCare; Appendix 1) on February 2 nd 2019. This service, although innovative, was offered as part of regular healthcare, hence ethical approval was not required under Italy's regulatory framework. All PDNSs affiliated with the telenursing service had longstanding experience in chronic neurological diseases care. They received additional PDspecific training, including an internship in an outpatient Movement Disorders Center, and participation in seminars and conferences dedicated to PD. Furthermore, they received training in using a digital communication platform and telephone communication techniques. We used open questions as well as the Non Motor Scale to assess several motor and non-motor symptoms at enrollment and at the final contact performed after 3 months of telenursing management (Appendix 2).",
