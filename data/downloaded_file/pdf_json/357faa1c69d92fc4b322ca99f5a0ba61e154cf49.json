Since then COVID-19, with its pulmonary and other systemic manifestations, has spread globally-with more than 4.2 million cases and over 291 000 deaths in 187 countries reported (2) . With spread of disease, abnormal coagulation variables with high incidence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) complications have been noted, raising the need to develop specific VTE diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (3) .",

Massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in one third of the cases, with an additional one fourth with recent deep venous thrombosis but without pulmonary embolism. Seventy-five percent were men and two thirds of these were noted to have recent thrombosis in prostatic venous plexus. Preexisting coronary heart disease (50%), respiratory tract, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus were noted but an absence of antemortem VTEs. Histologically exudative phase DAD was noted in two thirds and presence of pulmonary thrombi in 5 out of 8 cases with DAD. Similar histologic findings of DAD with microthrombi in 45% cases were also recently reported by Menter and associates in a series of 21 COVID-19 -positive autopsies, 4 with prominent central pulmonary embolism (11) .",

Significant preexisting comorbid conditions included hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, cancer, as well as history of cerebro-vascular disease (ischemic stroke in 4 patients) and pulmonary embolism (1 patient). After autopsy tissue fixation, grossly visible pulmonary thrombi were noted in all cases with associated infarcts in 9 out of these 11 (81%) autopsies. During their hospital stay, 10 of the 11 deceased patients had received prophylactic dose anticoagulant therapy, with 2 receiving this therapy even before admission; thus suggesting that pulmonary thrombi were formed despite anticoagulant therapy. Apart from DAD, histologic evaluation highlighted the presence of multiple thrombi in small to mid-sized pulmonary arteries with adjacent lung parenchymal infarcts.",

Thus, microvascular thrombosis is not a distinctive or diagnostic feature of lung parenchymal involvement in patients with COVID-19. Ultrastructural evidence of acute endothelial injury has also been demonstrated, regardless of and without correlation with the cause of ARDS. Macrothrombi (thrombi in arteries with internal diameter >1 mm), large microthrombi, and capillary microthrombi have also been reported in patients with ARDS, due to other causes listed above. Pulmonary infarcts are also seen in patients with ARDS who died sooner (10 to 19 days) and later (\u226520 days) after intubation (13) . Taken together, prior reports and more recent descriptions of DAD in COVID-19 suggest that these microscopic findings are not specific to the etiology, but rather a general feature of acute lung injury at various stages of response to injury.",
