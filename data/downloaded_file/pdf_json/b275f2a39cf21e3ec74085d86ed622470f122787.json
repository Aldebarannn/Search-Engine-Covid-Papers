While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short-and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decrease and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and the private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.",

            "text": "In December 2019, the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in Wuhan China [1] , leading to an outbreak that was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although we are currently in the early stages of the outbreak in Europe, the disease has already caused thousands of deaths and led to Government-enforced quarantine measures in several countries. Although the current focus of Governments and health ministries is to employ urgent measures to slow SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and minimize the number of infected individuals, the pandemic will potentially also have a substantial long-term impact on people with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Europe. While the focus on controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on NCDs is also of vital significance. It could further jeopardize the sustainability of healthcare systems by worsening the condition of patients with chronic conditions, as discussed below. The pandemic could potentially affect Quality Adjusted Life Years making the socio, clinical, and economic impact of NCDs even worse. There are almost 94 million persons aged 65 and over in the EU, accounting for an 18.5% share of the population [2] , and the majority of persons in this age group have multimorbidity, defined as multiple concurrent NCDs [3] . Here, we briefly discuss the various ways in which the pandemic may impact NCD management and affect patient outcomes in Europe.",

Moreover, it is still unclear how many nursing home residents have died from causes related to SARS-CoV-2 infection or the number of deaths from people who avoided seeking inpatient medical care for fear of getting infected. Many deaths involve men and individuals with preexisting medical conditions such as coronary diseases, hypertension, diabetes and active cancer, often with multimorbidity [6, 7] . The first reports mainly come from China and Italy [6, 7] but if these mortality patterns continue in other countries throughout the outbreak this has the potential to have a long-term effect on the prevalence of some NCD prevalence rates; NCDs that are associated with mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, such as cardiovascular disorders and diabetes may subsequently decrease in prevalence at the population level. Although there is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence on this issue yet, initial reports from scientific societies in Italy [8, 9] and Spain [10] suggest a substantial reduction in admission for stroke or Myocardial infarction since the start of the outbreak, for example. In Spain, cardiologists have seen a 40% reduction in heart attack treatments and a decrease in the number of diagnostic procedures [10] . It is imperative to establish the reasons behind these patterns. One hypothesis is that individuals do not go to the hospital even if they need to or that such cases are admitted to the hospital as a SARS-CoV-2 admission. There is also a shortage of healthcare staff to cover both SARS-CoV-2 related illness and all other routine medical care, as discussed below.",

Conditions such as community-acquired pneumonia are associated with cognitive decline [13] . Moreover, functional deterioration occurs quickly after hospitalization in a significant proportion of older patients after an acute event such as pneumonia and typically fails to improve by the time of discharge [14] .

Exercise is also important for reducing sarcopenia, falls, and fall-related injuries [17, 18] . Further, cardiorespiratory fitness is also associated with cognitive functioning in older persons [19] . In situations where opportunities for aerobic exercise training are limited, alternatives such as resistance exercise training may need to be proposed as potential alternatives, as evidence suggest that it may be as effective for reducing the risk of several chronic diseases [9] . Access to fresh food may be limited leading to changes in diet, which can affect a number of health outcomes including cognition [20] . Nutrition, exercise, cognitive training, and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors are all important for maintaining cognitive functioning and reducing the risk of chronic diseases in older persons [21] .",

Although there are no data available yet on this issue, it is likely that many NCD patients have decreased access to outpatient visits and one-on-one clinical advice, and, in some cases, there may be a shortage of medicines. Further, some patients may be reluctant to seek care due to fears of infection in healthcare settings. The situation is further exacerbated by the preexisting European shortage of skilled healthcare workers [32] and that many healthcare workers have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, which affects staffing levels. In the shortterm this has important consequences for integrated care programs, which are a vital element of the care of persons with NCDs, particularly patients with multimorbidity [33, 34] . Lack of integrated support from local health units and healthcare systems, whose focus in now on managing the COVID-19 crisis, may undermine welfare, particularly hitting vulnerable groups such as the elderly and persons with frailty and NCDs. In the long-term, reduced NCD management may have devastating consequences to some individuals, particularly those with multiple or more severe conditions who require regular symptom monitoring and adjustment of complex drug regimens. In addition, the redistribution of healthcare resources to fight the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is likely to have long term financial effects on national health systems throughout Europe, affecting patients both with non-communicable and communicable diseases. Indeed, it is also important that vaccination for other communicable diseases are not neglected as they are also of crucial importance for fighting against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and for maintaining better health and functioning in older individuals.",

The scaling down of outpatient visits, as mentioned above, in addition to quarantine measures that may affect access to pharmacies may have relevant clinical implications in terms of drug adherence. Further, as rapid research into the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals continues and the media report premature findings to the general public there may be dangerous consequences to patients who might start to self-manage their NCD medications. For example, in March 2020 reports emerged on potential adverse effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) on the risk of infection and the severity of SARS-CoV2, leading to the publication of a position statement from the European Society of Cardiology [35] urging physicians and patients not to discontinue antihypertensive treatment with ACEi or ARBs. Adherence to medication regimens and continuity of treatment is essential for the management of NCDs in older persons to avoid longterm negative health outcomes [36, 37] , and pharmacists may need to play a role in this, hopefully with the support of computerized prescription registries.",

We need to define an integrated strategy that could involve both private companies and institutional entities to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak. Politicians at national and European levels also need to prioritize this within their planning strategies during and after the pandemic. Actions to minimize the potentially devastating impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on older persons with NCDs should leverage on the use of cost-effective tools (e.g., digital health technologies) that could ensure access to both critical information (such as access to healthcare resources, clinical and lifestyle guidance, the importance of continuing vaccination programmes for other communicable diseases) and monitoring from healthcare professionals (including telemedicine). A common effort is needed to ensure the continuity of healthcare services, where the outbreak emergency could coercively push the adoption of sustainable solutions toward the decentralization of social and clinical assistance. These actions may include: awareness and education campaigns; tools to facilitate communication with healthcare professionals; improved access to institutional health communication and; better access to local and social support activities. The COVID-19 emergency has changed everyday life and we should take advantage of the lessons that we are learning from the experience, including building a healthcare system that is better able to protect the most fragile people in our society.",

Now, more than ever, a holistic approach to NCD patients (that involves General Practitioners, Geriatric and Internal Medicine Physicians, Epidemiologists, Psychiatrists, and Behavioral Psychologists etc.) is mandatory, and rapid solutions to support this must be identified and implemented with urgency. We also recognize the pivotal role of Patient Advocacy Associations to define and implement supportive action that properly address patients' needs.
