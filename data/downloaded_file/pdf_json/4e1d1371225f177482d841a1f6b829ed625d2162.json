DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are constitutively expressed by specific cell populations that play a key role in the activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. DC-SIGN is highly expressed at the surface of dendritic cells (DCs) localized in the lymphoid tissues (thymus, tonsils, or lymph nodes), mucosal surface, and in the dermis (3) (4) (5) . DC-SIGN is not expressed by Langerhans cells, which are a unique DC subset residing in epidermis. Certain macrophages such as Hofbauer cells in the placenta, Kupffer cells in the liver sinusoids, and alveolar macrophages have been shown to express DC -SIGN (3,4) .

These studies have paved the way for further investigations into interactions between DC-SIGN and pathogens and it has become clear that many viruses target DC-SIGN and L-SIGN to bind DCs and endothelial cells, respectively. Both lectins recognize high mannose oligosaccharides present on viral glycoproteins and thus function as attachment factors for several viruses including cytomegalovirus (CMV), dengue (DV), Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), hepatitis C (HCV), Marburg and Sindbis viruses (Table 1 ) (10, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Differential glycosylation of viral envelope glycoproteins strongly influences the efficiency of viral capture by DC-SIGN and L-SIGN (10, 19, 22) . For example, the DV envelope glycoprotein E has two conserved N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn-67 and Asn-153 that mediate DV binding to DCs (22).

Despite findings showing that a large fraction of viral particles captured by DC-SIGN are rapidly internalized and degraded (28,29), viruses are nevertheless able to hijack DC-SIGN and L-SIGN functions to spread infection. For the viruses examined to date, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have been shown to act as attachment factors rather than authentic entry receptors involved in membrane fusion. This does not exclude the possibility that some viruses, and particularly those that require targeting to acidified endosomes for membrane fusion, use these lectins as primary entry receptors. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN have also been shown to function as \"cis-receptors\" that enhance infection of target cells. This mechanism, known as cis-infection, has been described for DV, CMV, and HIV, and probably relies on the capacity of these lectins to concentrate viral particles at the cell surface, allowing optimal interaction with their cognate receptors and enhanced viral entry (Table 1) (18, 22, 30) . Viruses captured by DC-SIGN or L-SIGN can also be transmitted in trans to target cells expressing the entry receptors (\"trans-infection\" ), as has been proposed for HIV, HCV, and SARS virus (14, 16, 26, 31) . For HIV and CMV, DC-SIGN enhances infection of target cells at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI).

Their role as principal attachment factors for a broad range of enveloped viruses and their restricted expression in anatomical site of virus exposure suggest that these two lectins dictate viral tropism for DCs and endothelial cells and consequently may influence viral pathogenesis. DCs are sentinel cells that capture pathogens entering skin or mucosal tissues and then migrate to the lymph nodes where they present processed antigens to T-cells, initiating adaptive immune responses. By interacting with DC-SIGN, viruses that are transmitted sexually (such as HIV) or through introduction into human skin by an insect vector (such as dengue virus or Sindbis virus) may hijack DC function either to modulate the immune response or to assure their dissemination from peripheral tissues to lymphoid organs (32). LSECs also participate in the capture and processing of foreign antigens, in addition to the elimination of undesirable macromolecules from the blood by transporting them to hepatocytes (6,7). LSECs represent a barrier separating the liver and the blood and could be exploited by viruses such as HCV in order to gain access to hepatocytes (16,33,34) .
