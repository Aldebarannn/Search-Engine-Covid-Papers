Drug repurposing has become a promising approach because of the opportunity for reduced development timelines and overall costs. In the big data era, artificial intelligence (AI) and network medicine offer cutting-edge application of information science to defining disease, medicine, therapeutics, and identifying targets with the least error. In this Review, we introduce guidelines on how to use AI for accelerating drug repurposing or repositioning, for which AI approaches are not just formidable but are also necessary. We discuss how to use AI models in precision medicine, and as an example, how AI models can accelerate COVID-19 drug repurposing. Rapidly developing, powerful, and innovative AI and network medicine technologies can expedite therapeutic development. This Review provides a strong rationale for using AI-based assistive tools for drug repurposing medications for human disease, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

AI applications cover diverse fields, such as computer vision, voice recognition, natural language understanding, and digital pathology data analysis. Similarly, AI has been revolutionising drug discovery by extracting hidden patterns and evidence from biomedical data. Pharmaceutical companies and start-ups have used AI for drug discovery and development. 2 For example, IBM's Watson Health platform searches for drugs from vast amounts of textual data, including laboratory data, clinical reports, and scientific publications. 3 In this Review, we focus on AI technologies for a specific domain in drug discovery-that of drug repurposing-which offers rapid and cost-effective solutions for therapeutic development. These merits are especially clear in the COVID-19 global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), where de-novo drug discovery is almost infeasible (figure 1). Thus, the pandemic is a good opportunity for introducing advanced AI algorithms combined with network medicine for drug repurposing.",

Given the high attrition rates, substantial costs, and low pace of de-novo drug discovery, exploiting known drugs can help improve their efficacy while minimising side-effects in clinical trials. As Nobel Prize-winning pharmacologist Sir James Black said, \"The most fruitful basis for the discovery of a new drug is to start with an old drug\". 5 Drug repurposing, also termed drug repositioning, reprofiling or re-tasking, is a strategy for identifying new indications for approved or investigational (including clinically failed) drugs that have not been approved (panel) . Because the safety of these drugs has already been tested in clinical trials for other applications, repurposing known drugs can bring medications to patients much faster and with less cost than that of developing new drugs. For decades, academic institutions and science funders have championed the idea that screening libraries of existing drugs with various tests could uncover new applications, and have made observations that have led to medicines designed for one disease finding uses in another. Well known examples include sildenafil citrate for erectile dysfunction, 6 thalidomide for multiple myeloma, 7 and remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19. 8 Indeed, the increasing number of repositioned medications led to the idea that a systematic (hypothesis-free) screen of all known drugs might uncover additional compatible targets.",

Yet, without foreknowledge of the complete drug-target network, development of promising and affordable approaches for effective treatment of complex diseases is challenging. 10 Because drug targets do not operate in isolation from the complex system of proteins that comprise the molecular machinery of the cells with which they associate, each drug-target interaction (panel) should be examined in an integrative context (figure 2). 11 Therapeutic interventions need to consider the perturbation of disease system properties (termed network medicine [panel]), and have little to do, functionally speaking, with genetic and genomic events alone. 12 Observations and advances in network medicine further indicate that perturbations of cellular systems and the human interactome (panel) underlie the disease, which is the essence of drug discovery and develop ment. 12 Knowledge of the interplay Review between drug targets and human diseases can provide clues for possible drug repurposing because drugs that target one disease might target another through a shared functional protein-protein interaction network. 11 For example, SARS-CoV-2 requires host cellular factors (such as angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 [ACE2], trans membrane serine protease 2 [TMPRSS2], and furin; figure 1) for successful replication during infection. 13, 14 Systematic targeting of the viral protein and host protein interactions (the SARS-CoV-2 interactome) offers a novel strategy for effective drug repurposing for COVID-19. A SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome that contains 332 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between 26 viral proteins and human proteins was structed using affinity purification mass spectrometry. 15 69 drug candidates were prioritised that can target the host proteins in the SARS-CoV-2-host interactome. 15 Experimental assays validated the antiviral activities of two sets of agents: mRNA translation inhibitors (ie, zotatifin) and sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptor regulators (ie, haloperidol).",

However, convolutional neural network (CNN; panel) is particularly suitable for image processing. Instead of fully connecting neurons in adjacent layers, CNN uses filters (small matrices of weights) that apply a convolution operation on local patches of the images, which greatly reduces the number of weights. CNN has been used to analyse chemical images to obtain insight into drug therapeutic functions. 21 For example, AtomNet predicts the binding affinity of small molecules to proteins on the basis of the structural information extracted by CNN. 22 Biological sequences are another widely explored type of data for drug repurposing. However, neither FNN nor CNN appropriately consider the sequential nature of the Review data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are specifically designed for sequences in which the main building block is a recurrent cell appearing at each timestamp or sequence location that retains past information while learning new information in a sequence. RNN models have been used for generating focused molecule libraries for drug discovery, with the molecules represented as sequences using simplified molecular input line entry system codes. 23 Gao and colleagues 24 developed a hybrid approach of graph neural network and RNN to predict drug-target interactions. Beck and colleagues 25 developed a hybrid CNN and RNN model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction to predict whether any commercially available antiviral drugs could work in SARS-CoV-2.The authors computationally identified several known antiviral drugs, such as atazanavir, remdesivir , efavirenz, ritonavir, and dolutegravir, for the potential treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

One challenge for the graph embedding method is scalability. Real-world (knowledge) graphs are usually large. The number of entities in a medical knowledge graph could be as many as several million. Existing machine learning systems such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are mainly designed for data with regular structures but not for large-scale graphs. Therefore, several systems that are specifically designed for learning representations from large-scale graphs have been developed.

The FDA made this decision on the basis of early research showing that the drug might help speed up recovery for hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Mechanistically, remdesivir was shown to inhibit the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (figure 1). 37 A doubleblind, randomised, placebo-con trolled trial of intravenous remdesivir in adults hos pitalised with COVID-19 showed that remdesivir significantly shortens the median recovery time to 11 days, compared with 15 days in the placebo group. 8 These preliminary findings support the use of remdesivir for patients who are hospitalised with COVID-19 and require supplemental oxygen therapy. However, another randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial involving hospi talised patients not requiring mechanical ventilation did not show a significant difference between a 5-day course and a 10-day course of remdesivir. 38 Further investigation of the clinical benefits of rem desivir for patients with COVID-19 in different patient subgroups with or without mechanical ventilation is needed to identify the shortest effective duration of therapy. Additionally, whether remdesivir can shorten the recovery course of individuals with early COVID-19 is unknown. A study using machine learning and statistical analysis approaches discovered that mefuparib (CVL218), a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 inhibitor (figure 1), blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication without obv ious toxic effects in vitro. 39 The antiviral activity of mefuparib is more potent at viral entry and similar at viral post entry compared with remdesivir, sug gesting the drug to be a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug candidate.",

Drug combinations, offering increased therapeutic efficacy and reduced toxicity, play an important role in treating infectious diseases, inclu ding COVID-19 (eg, remdesivir plus baricitinib [NCT04401579]). However, our ability to identify and vali date effective combinations is limited by a huge increase in the number of possible drug pairs. Using a network-based methodology, 51 scientists identified three potential drug combinations for COVID-19, 16 including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin. These combinations are based on theoretical analysis using the interactome and have not been tested in preclinical or clinical studies. The same team further observed that com bining melatonin and toremifene showed potential for use in the treatment of COVID-19. 52 The selective estrogen modu lation and melatonin in early COVID-19 (SENTINEL; NCT04531748) trial is being done at the Cleveland Clinic to test the clinical efficacy of combining melatonin and toremifene therapy in patients with early COVID-19. 52 Using BenevolentAI's knowledge graph, 34 baricitinib was identified as potential treatment for COVID-19. At least two phase 2 randomised, double-blind trials of baricitinib alone or as part of combination therapy with antiviral drugs (eg, remdesivir) are underway for patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 (NCT04373044 and NCT04401579).",

Cellular or animal assays might not reflect the host environment of the virus infection in humans. Also, repurposed drugs might have been optimised for a particular target, dosing, or tissue in the original indications. Rapid clinical tests of existing antiviral, antimalarial, and immunomodulatory drugs have been done or are underway against COVID-19. Many trials did not optimise the drug's clinical benefits and biological questions because of their expedient design, lack of clinical endpoints, small number of patients enrolled (thus lack of statistical power), and more. 64 For example, hydroxy chloroquine shows potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities in in vitro assays. 65 However, hydroxychloroquine has shown very little or no efficiency in preclinical 66 and clinical trial studies. 49 Few reproducible preclinical animal models and gold-standard clinical outcome measures in COVID-19 trials might also result in some failures to find clinical benefits. Tools and analyses with greater sensitivity are also required to detect differences between drugs and placebos, especially as more mildly affected patients with COVID-19 are included in trials. The presence of heterogeneous populations with different genetic backgrounds might also affect outcomes of clinical results. Possible factors contributing to these clinical trial findings that should be accounted for in future trials include targeting the wrong pathobiological or pathophysiological mechanisms in COVID-19; using drugs that do not engage with the intended target (including virus proteins and virus-host and proteinprotein interactome); intervening at the wrong stage of the disease, including early, mild, moderate, and severe illnesses; lacking translatable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (ie, poor lung penetration) biomarkers; depending on in vitro antiviral activities and not using appropriate animal models with poor predictive efficacy; not addressing the rapid disease progression of COVID-19 in a short period; and not accurately monitoring the complexity of the clinical and biological characteristics to therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "Advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics indicated that disease treatment would be considerably improved if therapies were guided by individual's genomic profiles. This hypothesis has garnered initial success in some diseases, including cancer. 77 Responsive ness to a drug is influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. SARS-CoV-2 infection has shown large inter-individual variabilities, ranging from asymp tomatic to severe and lethal disease. One possible hypothesis is that human genetics might determine clinical characteristics and drug responses. 69, 78 For example, analysis of approximately 81 000 genomes and exomes from the general population suggested that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine might only work for TMPRSS2-absent patients who are infected by SARS-CoV-2. 69 An international team showed that hydroxychloroquine has antiviral activity in the kidney cells of African green monkeys without TMPRSS2 expression (VeroE6) but not in the model of reconstituted human airway epithelium developed from primary nasal or bronchial cells. 67 Additionally, another team showed that chloroquine does not block SARS-CoV-2 infection of the TMPRSS2-positive lung cell line Calu-3. 68 These preli minary findings highlight the importance of pharma cogenomics studies in improving clinical benefits and the success rate of drug repurposing. A COVID-19 host genetics initiative is underway to generate, share and analyse data in a search for the genetic determinants of COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, and outcomes, and personalised treatment. Therefore, AI techniques could leverage massive genetic and genomic data to identify human genetic determinants of SARS-CoV-2 patho genesis, which presents a unique opportunity for drug repurposing in precision medicine and personalised treatment for individuals with COVID-19 ( figure 3) .

            "text": "The future of AI-informed drug repurposing Drug selection among the many approved ones, while avoiding time-consuming searches, can present uncertainty. To date, AI's potential ability to identify new candidate therapies that can be made available for clinical trials rapidly and, if approved, merged into health care is unparalleled, making AI a centrepiece of advanced tech nologies. Because of this, AI is a promising method for accelerating drug repurposing for human diseases, espe cially emerging diseases, such as COVID-19. With the availability of big data, including biological, clinical, and open data (scientific publications and data repositries), novel AI techniques capable of leveraging these large sets of biomedical data are in high demand. Pharmaceutical scientists, computer scientists, statisticians, and physi cians are increasingly involved in developing and adopting AI-based technologies for the rapid development of thera peutics. AI approaches, coupled with big data, have the potential to substantially improve the efficiency and effec tiveness of drug repur posing and aid medical decision making of therapeutic benefits with real-world evidence for various complex human diseases, such as COVID-19 (figure 1) and Alzheimer's disease. 79 However, challenges remain in developing these AI tools, such as data heterogeneity and low quality, and insufficient data sharing by pharma ceutical companies, as well as the security and inter pretability of the models. We expect future successful AI models for drug repurposing to be accurate in terms of the generated outcomes, integrative of disparate information types and sources, interoperable in diverse deployment settings, inter pretable of internal working mechanisms, and robust to noise and adversarial attacks.",
