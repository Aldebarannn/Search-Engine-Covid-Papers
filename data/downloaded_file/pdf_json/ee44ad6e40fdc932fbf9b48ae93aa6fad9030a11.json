            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first reported case of COVID-19 was in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The disease has continued to spread globally and was classified as a pandemic in March by the World Health Organization. Coronaviruses belong to a family of single-stranded RNA viruses, which cause several respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and neurologic diseases (1) (2) (3) . Similar to the viruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus (CoV) identified that can infect humans (2, 4, 5) . Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have an incubation period of 3-14 days with a mean period of 5 days (1, 5, 6) . The most common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, and bleeding (2, 4, 5, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Other symptoms include taste changes, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding (2, 4, 5, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . If left untreated, COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute respiratory failure resulting in death (1, 5, 6) . The number one risk factor for severe disease is age with the severity increasing with the presence of comorbidities, such as heart and lung diseases (1, 5, 6) . However, the effects of gender and ethnicity on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and severity remain an area of active investigation.",

From a socioeconomic perspective, school closures force more women with families to provide informal care for their immediate families, which limits women's work and economic opportunities for advancement (13) . These differences are further compounded by the unique physical, sanitary, and security needs of women in quarantine conditions compared to men (13) . Furthermore, data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) suggest that ethnic differences between COVID-19 patients may influence susceptibility and mortality. However, the mechanism for such differences remains mostly unknown (14) . Another theory for these differences is related to differences in the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which is the primary receptor for viral entry into the cells. In this article, we aim to elaborate on the effect of gender and ethnic backgrounds on COVID-19 infection and related mortality.",

The authors concluded that the fatality rate was higher in men, possibly due to an increased prevalence of cardiopulmonary disease and smoking (15) . Men were also more likely to develop heightened systemic inflammation, multi-organ dysfunction, and cardiac injury (15) . A similar study of 54 deceased COVID-19 patients in South Korea showed that 61% of the patients were male.",

A multivariate analysis performed in this study showed that male sex was a significant risk factor (OR: 2.206, 95% CI: 1.012-4.809) for prolonged (>14 days) COVID-19 symptoms (16) . However, since 49% of these patients had chronic diseases, the authors believed that older male patients might have an increased risk for COVID-19, resulting in longer hospital stays and slow recovery (16) . Similarly, another study showed that the male gender was a significant factor for COVID-19 infection on logistic regression analysis, with elderly male patients being at higher risk for the virus (17) . Another study examined 46 deceased COVID-19 patients and found that men accounted for 67% of the fatalities (18) . However, higher mortality in males could be a reflection of increased risk and prevalence of COVID-19 among male patients rather than being correlated with the male gender (18) . A study examining 133 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan China, reported a similar male-predominance (58% male vs. 42% female) of COVID-19 infections (19) . The study found that male patients were more likely than females (odds ratio: 3.24; 95% CI: 1.31-8.02) to shed the COVID-19 (20) . Specifically, male patients continued to shed the COVID-19 virus for 18 days, while females shed the virus for 15.2 days (19) .",

These results are in contrast to Chinese data, which estimated \u223c51% of COVID-19 patients were male (22) . The authors suggest the difference may reflect differences in social activities from different countries; in South Korea, the largest social age group are in their 20s. Furthermore, contact tracing of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea suggested that female practitioners of the Daegu religious sect may have contributed to the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, gender disparities in COVID-19 may reflect social and cultural differences between different countries (22) . In a similar study in Qingdao City, China, examining 44 COVID-19 patients showed that 66% were female. The female predominance reported in this study was likely due to the small sample size during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic (23) .",

For pregnant women infected with COVID-19, there are reports of fetal distress, preterm delivery, and intrauterine virus transmission in the third trimester; however, the lack of information has produced much uncertainty concerning the overall health of the mother and fetus exposed to COVID-19 (28) . Therefore, pregnant women are treated aggressively if exposed to COVID-19 and remain a vulnerable risk group to the COVID-19 virus (28) . Furthermore, pregnant women face additional challenges with work, childrearing, and maternal services, which further increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19 (28) . Women may also have limited access to acute and emergency reproductive services forcing many women to travel long distances to safe medical facilities or have their child delivered at home in developing countries (28) . In addition, cesarean sections and abortion care are also limited due to staff shortages and increased risk of COVID-19 infections in surgical wards (28) . In poorer countries, these limitations are further compounded by the limited access to routine clinical care for contraceptive counseling or other reproductive health services (28) .",

In addition, more women compared to men worry that they would put themselves at risk of exposure to coronavirus because they cannot afford to stay home and miss work (39 and 31%). Women also reported having more part-time jobs than men (13 vs. 9%) and worried more than men about whether they would be able to afford testing or treatment for coronavirus if they need it (40 vs. 31%) (31) . Given the increased stress reported in this survey, women were also asked questions about their mental health. The survey found that more women (16%) than men (11%) felt that worry or stress related to COVID-19 would have a significantly negative impact on their mental health.

Furthermore, women are the primary caregiver for the young, the elderly, and sick in most households and healthcare facilities (32) . Despite this, women remain underrepresented in most political and healthcare organizations (32) .

Furthermore, patients presenting with mild symptoms of cough, fever, and headache may have been misdiagnosed with influenza rather than COVID-19. Given the rapid changes in this pandemic, the data on infection rate, morbidity, and mortality between male and female COVID-19 patients will likely improve with larger sample sizes and greater distribution of age and ethnic backgrounds.",

            "text": "Although the precise mechanism of gender differences in COVID-19 remains unknown, previous studies provide insights into possible mechanisms. Previous studies have shown females have increased resistance to viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic organisms than males (38) . Specifically, females are less susceptible to microbial infections by mounting a higher innate immune response than males (39, 40) . Women produce a higher expression of the inflammatory and cytotoxic proteins, including interferon-g (IFN-g), lymphotoxin b (LTb), granzyme A (GZMA), interleukin-12 receptor b2 (IL12Rb2), and granulysin (GNLY) (39) . Furthermore, female patients are less likely to produce extreme immune responses to bacterial or viral infections than male patients leading to sepsis. A study examining gender differences in sepsis patients found that male patients have higher circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1 than female patients, which are correlated with a worse prognosis (41) . Female sepsis patients were protected from sepsis due to the increased production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 (41). Specifically, female patients produce lower levels of inflammatory mediators and increase the production of immunosuppressive molecules to reduce systemic inflammation. The protection of females to microbial and viral affections is attributed to the protection provided by the X chromosome and sex hormones, which modulate the innate and adaptive immunity (38) . In contrast, males are at higher risk of developing cancers as opposed to females who have a higher risk of autoimmune diseases (38) .",

Similar studies with Hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV, Hantavirus, West Nile Virus infections, and influenza viruses showed that men were more susceptible than females to viral infections (48) . However, the study also found that the hyperactive response in female immune systems to viral infections may increase symptom severity and pathological effects than observed in male patients (49) . The authors hypothesized that effect could result from an increase in the production of cytokines, chemokines, and interferons in females than males (50) . Following the elimination of the viral infection, females maintain elevated immune responses that can increase the risk of post-infection complications compared to men (50) . Given these disparities in viral symptoms, female patients infected with COVID-19 may experience more long-term complications than men. Further investigation into the immune response to COVID-19 between male and female patients will be needed.",

Furthermore, there was no difference observed in the ACE2 expression in the heart and lungs of both rats and mice (60, 61) . Interestingly, the expression of ACE2 changes through the life-span of female rats through fluctuations in estradiol (E 2 ); in particular, the expression of ACE2 increases significantly during pregnancy (62) .

Third, there needs to be an increase in scientific and pathological studies assessing the expression and activity of ACE-2 to identify which patient populations are most at risk. Currently, there have been few studies investigating ACE-2 expression in COVID-19 patients and whether ACE-2 inhibitors may provide therapeutic benefit. Further genetic and biomedical studies are needed to determine if other biomarkers exist for evaluating susceptible populations and guiding patient management.

A recent study showed that there was a 29% reduction in men seeking medical treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic; in contrast, there was no change in women hospitalized (64) . It is believed that the association of cardiovascular illness among men with COVID-19 may cause male patients to be reluctant in seeking medical attention for cardiovascular illness (64) . Furthermore, the co-existence of COVID-19 symptoms may mask the symptoms of a heart attack among male patients (64) . Male patients are also known to have a higher treatmentseeking threshold due to the prevalence of male stoicism and self-reliance (64) . Therefore, physicians may be required to investigate other medical conditions in addition to COVID-19 to avoid under-diagnosing potential devastating medical conditions, such as heart disease, among male COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "The current epidemiological data suggests that men are more affected than women by the COVID-19 virus (65) . However, these studies are limited by location, sample size, and other potential biases in the population examined. Different clinical studies have given conflicting reports on the male or female predominance of COVID-19 infections. This discrepancy is likely due to the lack of large-scale epidemiological studies, socioeconomic disparities, or other confounders on the prevalence of pre-existing conditions in different countries. Recent epidemiological data from 38 countries showed a male predominance in COVID-19 infections, which increased in older age demographics. Furthermore, the case fatality rate was 1.7 times higher in men than females (65) . The authors of the study suggested that differences in sex hormones, sex chromosomes, genetic polymorphisms, and epigenetic modifications between males and females may impact immune responses (65) . Specifically, the authors reported that the ACE-2 receptor is located on the X chromosome and is down-regulated by increased estrogen levels (65) . However, the expression of ACE-2 seems to increase with age and with the menstrual cycle of female mice. Therefore, it is possible that the increased expression of ACE-2 expression in elderly and pregnant patients may increase their risk for COVID-19. In general, the increased estrogen in females reduces their chance of viral infections from increase macrophage/neutrophil/dendritic cell activity, humoral response, and T-cell function compared to males. It is believed that the increased immune response in females reduces their susceptibility to COVID-19. The biological mechanism behind these differences also needs further elucidation.",

The current literature suggests that men tend to have a higher risk of severe infection and mortality related to COVID-19. It is believed that elevated estrogen levels in female COVID-19 patients may reduce the severity and mortality of COVID-19 deaths through an elevation in the innate and humoral response. Furthermore, pre-clinical studies suggest that ACE-2 expression may increase the susceptibility of COVID-19 in pregnant patients. Similarly, the severity and mortality with COVID-19 differ between different ethnic groups. Although genetic polymorphisms associated with COVID-19 susceptibility among ethnic groups remains unknown, the increase in medical comorbidities and lack of access to care are significant contributors to increased COVID-19 mortality in these communities. As the pandemic continues to spread, African American and Hispanic communities have shown increased rates of infection and hospitalization compared to Caucasian populations. These differences are likely due to a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease in minority groups.",

Furthermore, the role of ACE-2 expression in male and female COVID-19 patients remains unknown. Pre-clinical studies show no difference in ACE-2 expression between male and female murine models. Additional studies are needed to evaluate whether expression levels of ACE-2 in the lung correlated with the severity or susceptibility of COVID-19 in human subjects. In the meantime, policies for reducing the spread of COVID-19 should take into consideration the unique challenges among men and women, including social, emotional, physical, and economic security.",
