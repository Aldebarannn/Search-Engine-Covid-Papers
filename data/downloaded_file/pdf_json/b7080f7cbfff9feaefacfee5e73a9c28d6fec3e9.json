            "text": "The benefits of inhaling hydrogen gas (H 2 ) have been widely reported but its pharmacokinetics have not yet been sufficiently analyzed. We developed a new experimental system in pigs to closely evaluate the process by which H 2 is absorbed in the lungs, enters the bloodstream, and is distributed, metabolized, and excreted. We inserted and secured catheters into the carotid artery (CA), portal vein (PV), and supra-hepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) to allow repeated blood sampling and performed bilateral thoracotomy to collapse the lungs. Then, using a hydrogen-absorbing alloy canister, we filled the lungs to the maximum inspiratory level with 100% H 2 . The pig was maintained for 30 seconds without resuming breathing, as if they were holding their breath. We collected blood from the three intravascular catheters after 0, 3, 10, 30, and 60 minutes and measured H 2 concentration by gas chromatography. H 2 concentration in the CA peaked immediately after breath holding; 3 min later, it dropped to 1/40 of the peak value. Peak H 2 concentrations in the PV and IVC were 40% and 14% of that in the CA, respectively. However, H 2 concentration decay in the PV and IVC (half-life: 310 s and 350 s, respectively) was slower than in the CA (half-life: 92 s). At 10 min, H 2 concentration was significantly higher in venous blood than in arterial blood. At 60 min, H 2 was detected in the portal blood at a concentration of 6.9-53 nL/mL higher than at steady state, and in the SVC 14-29 nL/mL higher than at steady state. In contrast, H 2 concentration in the CA decreased to steady state levels. This is the first report showing that inhaled H 2 is transported to the whole body by advection diffusion and metabolized dynamically.",

In the case of gas, unlike oral and injectable drugs, a non-clinical pharmacokinetic study with a single dose has not been performed. This was because there was no animal protocol for a single-dose study of the gas. The same is true for H 2 . It remained undetermine whether H 2 diffused from the lungs in a blood flow-independent manner or whether H 2 was transported throughout the body in a blood flow-dependent manner.

The liver has a dual blood supply from the PV and the hepatic artery. About 75% of the blood flow to the liver comes from the PV and 25% from the hepatic artery. Oxygen is supplied by the PV and the hepatic artery in half each. Therefore, in contrast to the brain, the liver has been regarded as the organ where inhaled H 2 is least likely to reach [16] . The liver is the largest organ in the body, performing a number of functions that are essential for life, such as metabolism, detoxification, and excretion, so protecting it with H 2 is considered to be a great advantage. We wanted to find out how much H 2 is consumed as it passes through the liver, so we compared the H 2 concentrations in the PV and supra-hepatic IVC. The H 2 concentration of CA immediately after inhalation was very high, and it was confirmed that the inhaled H 2 reached the brain efficiently. The peak H 2 concentrations of PV and IVC were 40% and 14% of CA, respectively, indicating that inhaled H 2 is relatively difficult to reach the liver, but the liver actively consumes the H 2 .",

This is presumed to be due to the fact that the H 2 diffused into the tissues, which was not metabolized, is gradually returned to the venous blood.

In patients with severe COVID-19, the immune over-response causes the production of large amounts of cytokines by alveolar macrophages, which becomes a cytokine storm, resulting in the progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome, abnormal blood coagulation, and multiple organ failure [21] . H 2 gas not only inhibits the overproduction of cytokines [13] , but also suppresses vascular endothelial damage [20] , facilitates the flow of red blood cells in microvessels and increases the efficiency of gas exchange (M.S. unpublished observation). Accordingly, H 2 inhalation therapy has great potential to improve the life expectancy of intubated COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit with severe hypoxemia. The HYBRID II Trial (Efficacy of inhaled HYdrogen on neurological outcome following BRain Ischemia During out-of-hospital cardiac arrest), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, controlled clinical trial investigating the efficacy of H 2 inhalation therapy for patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, has been underway since 2017 using a hydrogenated oxygen supply device jointly developed by Keio University and Taiyo Nippon Sanso (jRCTs031180352) [4] . In the HYBRID II trial, patients after cardiopulmonary arrest and resuscitation have been treated with hydrogenated oxygen for 18 hours in combination with conventional cooling methods. Prior to Hybrid II, we had conducted an open-label, single-arm, prospective interventional trial at Keio University Hospital in Tokyo in 2014 to evaluate the feasibility and safety of H 2 inhalation in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest achieved a spontaneous return of circulation [5] . Non-cardiogenic cardiac arrest patients were also enrolled in this TRIAL; 5 patients were entered, one of whom was a CA patient due to severe pneumonia and septic shock. This patient had a stable respiratory state during H 2 inhalation, but died after H 2 inhalation was completed due to a rapid deterioration of the respiratory state. Based on this experience, we are considering a study protocol in which patients with severe COVID-19 disease will continue to receive hydrogenated oxygen for at least one week until their hypoxemia has sufficiently improved. In China, the hydrogen-oxygen mixture gas inhaler was certified as a national class III medical device in February, and it is reported to have a certain effect on the improvement of hypoxic symptoms of COVID-19-related pneumonia. We hope to bring this new treatment to patients as quickly as possible in order to save the lives of severely ill patients with COVID-19.",
