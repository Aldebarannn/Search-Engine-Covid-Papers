Moreover, anti-HAdV4 immunity provided 60% protection from adenovirus-related hospitalization and 98% protection from infection [1, 25] . In the Korean military, it is not certain why active duty service personnel were infected less frequently than trainees. One possibility is that the former group may have had preexisting HAdV-55 antibodies from previous exposure. Another possibility is that the former group had other cross-protective HAdV antibodies. In 2006, HAdV-7 was the dominant type of HAdV in the Korea military [26] . HAdV-7 is in the same species group as HAdV-55 (HAdV-7/11/14/55 are in species group B) [27] . When a HAdV-14 outbreak occurred at U.S. military training facilities, preexisting HAdV-7 neutralizing antibodies provided cross-protection against HAdV-14 in recruits [28] .

Although the mean fever duration in HAdV pneumonia patients was similar to those in previous studies (6-9 days) [21, 31, 32] , patients with HAdV pneumonia had higher and longer fevers than the HAdV-negative group. Moreover, the fever duration associated with severe HAdV pneumonia was prolonged relative to that of mild-moderate pneumonia, again corroborating previous reports [32] . Patients with HAdV pneumonia also had more upper respiratory tract symptoms than those in the negative group, suggesting that HAdV infected or colonized the upper respiratory tract first, then progressed to a lower respiratory tract infection. The most typical laboratory findings of HAdV pneumonia were febrile leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. In agreement with our results, Vento et al. [33] demonstrated lower WBC and platelet counts in a HAdV-14 pneumonia among U.S. military trainees. Patients with severe pneumonia had fewer WBC and lower platelet counts than those with mild to moderate pneumonia. Moreover, the mean times from fever onset to the nadir of WBC and to the greatest radiologic aggravation were similar and correlated (r = 0.513, p <0.001). These findings suggest that hematologic parameters might be used to monitor HAdV pneumonia and to index risk factors for disease progression. Finally, although the CRP levels were moderately elevated in our study, the mean procalcitonin level was only 0.35 \u03bcg/L, confirming that a bacterial infection was unlikely [34] .

Most patients in our study were treated empirically with antibiotics, and most HAdV pneumonia cases were self-limiting without an antiviral agent. However, cidofovir was administered at a 5-mg/kg weekly dose to two severe HAdV pneumonia patients. One patient recovered without sequelae, whereas the other patient died. It would be unsafe to offer cidofovir to all HAdV pneumonia patients because of the risk of renal toxicity. Moreover, this drug is expensive and is not stocked regularly in hospitals. In this respect, the early identification of patients who might develop severe pneumonia is most important when selecting cases that will receive antiviral treatment [23] . Interestingly, the PSI scores and CURB-65 values were higher in the severe pneumonia group, whereas the absolute scores in this group did not indicate high risk.
