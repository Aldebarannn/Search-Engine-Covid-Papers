High throughput data comes to us from DNA and RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, metabolomics, molecular screens, and more. Although some accept the approach of compartmentalizing data generation and data analysis, we have found scientists feel empowered when they can both ask and answer their own biological questions [1] . In our experience performing microbiome research, it is more common to find exceptional bench scientists who are inexperienced at analyzing large data sets than to find the reverse. Of course, this raises a challenge: how do we train bench scientists to effectively answer biological questions with these larger data sets?",

Regardless of the discipline, a Journal Club involves group discussion of a preselected paper that can range from informal discussions to PowerPoint presentations and course credit. In addition to building upon material from traditional coursework and staying current on the literature, Journal Clubs help strengthen skills in critical thinking, communication, and integrating the literature [11] . Because most Journal Clubs occur on a regular schedule, they are effective by virtue of repeated practice. With this model in mind, over the past four years we have experimented with creating a Code Club model with the goal of improving reproducible data analysis skills in a laboratory environment.",

Initially, the Code Club was used to review code from trainee projects. Instead of a presentation, the presenter would project their code onto a screen and the participants would go through the code, stating the logic behind each line. This approach emphasized the importance of code readability and gave beginners the opportunity to see the real-life, messy code of more experienced peers. Unfortunately, the format only allowed us to review a fraction of a project's code, making it difficult to integrate the programmer's logic across their full project. A major issue with this model was that sometimes beginners could not contribute to improving the code, and even when they could, more experienced group members would eventually dominate the discussion. This led to a lack of participation by beginners, who would sometimes mentally withdraw, resulting in an adversarial environment between the presenter and more experienced members. As a result, presenters were reluctant to offer to present again.",

            "text": "From these experiences, we began a collective conversation to improve our Code Club model. We have identified two successful approaches. The first is a more constructive version of a group code review. The presenter clearly states the problem they want to solve, breaks the participants into smaller groups, and then asks each group to solve the problem, or a portion of it. For example, someone may have an R script with a repeating chunk of code. The challenge for the session would be to convert the code chunk into a function to be called throughout the script to make it \"DRY\" (i.e., Don't Repeat Yourself [12] ). The presenter leaves the session with several partial or working solutions to their problem, and the importance of writing DRY code is reinforced. The second approach is a tutorial. The presenter introduces a new package or technique and assigns an activity to practice the new approach. For example, at one Code Club, participants were given raw data and a finished plot. Paired participants were tasked with generating the plot from the data using R syntax from either the base language or the ggplot2 package. For this exercise, base R users had to use ggplot2 and vice versa. In either approach, the Code Club ends with a report back to the larger group describing the approach each pair took. We generally find that preparing a Code Club session takes similar effort to preparing a Journal Club presentation. Our Code Clubs typically have 7 to 10 participants, but the inherent \"think-pair-share\" approach should allow it to be scaled to groups of variable sizes [13] .",

Participants will always notice or ask about code concepts that are not the focus of the exercise; a presenter with a specific goal can bring tangential conversations back to the planned task. Where possible, presenters should create a simplified scenario (i.e., minimal, reproducible example [14] ), which can be helpful in focusing the participants. The presenter should verify ahead of time that the simplified example works and behaves the way they expect. Beyond the content, clear goals for participant activities will help both parties stay on task and avoid frustration. For more advanced learners, the presenter can create stretch goals or give an activity with multiple stopping points where participants would feel successful (e.g., commenting code, creating function, implementing function, refactoring function).

We once had a presenter try to teach basic, but unfamiliar, Julia syntax. Unfortunately, the time was up before the participants had installed the interpreter. Some tips to help keep it simple are to limit the presented code chunks to less than 50 lines or, conversely, consider the number of lines that might be required to accomplish a solution.

This might also uncover weak points in the presenter's plan and enable them to ensure that the materials work as intended before the Code Club. We have found that using GitHub repositories for each Code Club can help make information, scripts, and data easily available to participants. Although this can be convenient, introducing GitHub on top of the session's activities can impose a significant cognitive load and frustration to those not already comfortable with GitHub. Perhaps a first Code Club could introduce using git and GitHub to engage in collaborative coding. A lower barrier entry point for the presenter is posting their code, data, and information in a lab meeting-dedicated Slack channel or via email.

We have also identified several strategies to overcome the challenges presented by participants at varying skill levels. Central to the Code Club format is the use of paired programming [15] . Instead of letting participants form their own pairs, the presenter can select pairs of participants with either similar or differing skill levels, depending on the presenter's goals. Partnerships between those with similar skill levels require the presenter to design appropriate activities for each skill level. We have found that commenting code is a good skill for beginners because it forces them to dissect and understand a code chunk line by line. It also reinforces the value of commenting as they develop their skills and independence. An advantage of forming partnerships between people with disparate skill levels is that it is more likely for groups to provide the presenter with a diverse range of methods that achieve the same result. This approach to pairing also helps to graft new members that have emerging programming skills. Regardless of how partners are selected, consider asking the pairs to identify a navigator and a driver [16] . The driver types at the computer while the navigator tells them what to type, thus ensuring participation of both partners. Midway through the activity, the presenter can have the partners switch roles. Intentionally forming pairs can also engineer group interactions by avoiding potentially disruptive partnerships or pairing reliable role models with new group members.",

Having an open laptop on the table and permission to use it can feel like an invitation to get distracted by other work, emails, and browsing the internet; fight that urge and focus on the presenter's goals. Be respectful and allow your partner to contribute. Speak up for yourself and force your partner to let you contribute. If the material seems too advanced for you, it can be frustrating, and tempting to mentally check out. Fortunately, programming languages like R and Python are generally expressive, which should allow you to engage with the logic, even if the syntax is too advanced. Oftentimes, understanding the logic of when to use one modeling approach over another is more important than knowing how to use it. If you understand the \"why,\" the \"how\" will quickly follow. More experienced participants should aim to communicate feedback and coding suggestions at a level that all participants can understand and engage in. Regardless of skill levels, your partner and the presenter put themselves in a vulnerable position by revealing what they do or do not know. Encourage them and show your gratitude for helping you learn something new by fully participating in each Code Club.",

            "text": "The most important rules are the first and last. Members of the Code Club need to feel comfortable with other group members and sufficiently empowered to try something new or ask for help. Aside from expanding our programming skills, we have noticed two other benefits that help create a positive culture. First, we have intentionally interviewed postdoctoral candidates on the days we hold Code Club. We make it clear that they are not being assessed on their coding skills, but instead use it as an opportunity to see how the candidate interacts with other members of the research group. At the same time, the candidate can learn about the culture of the research group through active participation. Second, members of other research groups have integrated themselves into our Code Club to minimize the isolation they feel in growing their skills within smaller research groups. This speaks to both the broader need for Code Club and the likelihood of success when expanded to include a larger group of individuals with broader research interests. There is no reason that the Code Club format would not work with groups independent of a research group as long as everyone follows the Rules. Finding data sets and applications that are interesting to a critical mass of people is essential to starting and sustaining such a group. Ultimately, Code Club has improved the overall data analysis skills, community, and research success of our lab by empowering researchers to seek help from their colleagues.",
