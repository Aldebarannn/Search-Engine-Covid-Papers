This paper examines care of children with life-limiting conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although children, overall, appear to be less affected than adults, 1-4 the implications of COVID-19 for children with life-limiting conditions is less clear. The lower incidence rate of the disease amongst children, and an apparently low rate of severe cases, means little was known during the early months of the pandemic about the potential impact of COVID-19 on children. [5] [6] [7] [8] There was some evidence that children with severe COVID-19 had pre-existing comorbidities, 9, 10 although this only emerged many months into the pandemic. In addition, children were potentially vulnerable to both health and psychosocial 11 implications of the pandemic given the unprecedented changes to their normal daily routines (e.g., school closures, changes to parents' employment, and cancellations of social and sporting commitments). 8 Communication is pivotal for realising the holistic focus of palliative care, [12] [13] [14] providing the means to understand the physical, mental, social, cultural, and spiritual needs of patients and their families. [15] [16] [17] The urgency of caring for children with complex and serious conditions requires that care must continue during the pandemic, albeit with adjustments to service delivery. 18, 19 To reduce the risk of infection, a greater proportion of palliative care consultations during the pandemic were reconfigured to telehealth. [18] [19] [20] Beyond changes to the medium for consultations, it is still relatively unknown how the content of consultations within paediatric palliative care also might have changed during the pandemic. Guidelines and scripts were developed to guide clinicians confronted with the rapid changes of the pandemic, both within healthcare systems and across societies more generally. [21] [22] [23] Initial resources about communication during the pandemic focused on communicating with and about patients who had COVID-19. 24, 25 Additional resources were developed later for communicating with patients and families receiving standard, ongoing care for other conditions during the pandemic. 26 These guidelines provided suggestions for how clinicians might set up a specific conversation about the pandemic with patients as part of an otherwise routine clinical encounter. These guidelines were not, however, based on direct observational evidence of communication within palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, most guidance focussed on adult, rather than paediatric, care. The current study addresses these gaps, by comparing video-recordings of actual, real-world instances of communication in paediatric palliative care consultations prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The peak months of the pandemic became an opportunity to understand how the provision of paediatric palliative care is maintained, potentially with adaptations, during the uncertainty of a pandemic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 626, "end": 629, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 630, "end": 633, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 634, "end": 637, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 638, "end": 641, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 733, "end": 735, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 736, "end": 738, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 879, "end": 881, "text": "11", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1086, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1165, "end": 1169, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1174, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1175, "end": 1179, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1310, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1311, "end": 1315, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1316, "end": 1320, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1494, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1497, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1642, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1647, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1648, "end": 1652, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2021, "end": 2025, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2030, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2031, "end": 2035, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2164, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2167, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2330, "end": 2332, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This study was part of a larger project that examined communication between healthcare professionals and families within paediatric palliative care services in Australia.

Topics typical of standard paediatric palliative care consultations often led to discussion of the pandemic. This was introduced between one and seven times within each of the ten consultations recorded during the pandemic (total = 33, mean = 3.3 times per consultation) and often led to extended sequences of interaction. Within these consultations, topics typical of standard paediatric palliative care consultations often led to discussion of the pandemic. These topics were diverse, spanning medical discussions (e.g. pain medication) and psychosocial and lifestyle discussions that are a key part of the holistic, supportive care provided within palliative care services (e.g. school, parents' caring/work responsibilities). Of the 33 fragments analysed, the pandemic was raised by clinicians in 18 fragments (55%) and parents in 15 fragments (45%). The pervasive and varied nature of the talk about the pandemic is analysed in detail in the below fragments, which are exemplars of the broader corpus of consultations. First, some fragments of typical talk from consultations recorded prior to the pandemic are considered. These will be compared with similar fragments from the consultations recorded during the pandemic. These typical sequences of conversation also were observed in consultations recorded during the pandemic. As will be shown in the next section, however, the sequences shifted to a different trajectory relevant to life during the pandemic.

In the first example below, a concern was raised by a parent about the treatment of their child during the pandemic period. In the initial conversation, a telehealth consultation between the doctor and father, the father had mentioned that ibuprofen seemed to work better than paracetamol for relieving their child's headaches. This topic of pain relief has been raised again now, this time by the doctor (lines 1-2), who recommends giving the child Nurofen\u00ae (a popular brand of ibuprofen) for pain relief from these headaches. The doctor's recommendation at lines 1-2 involves standard advice related to giving the child Nurofen\u00ae. As seen in Fragment 1 above, recommendations to give paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief is a common practice in paediatric palliative care consultations. They are often used as pain relief for mild to moderate pain and are typically accepted by parents without further discussion. In this instance, however, this standard recommendation leads to a different response from the father. The father provides some initial agreement ('yeah yeah', line 4) and then provides a 'but' conjunction ('but we've had some concerns with coronavirus'). The conjunctive 'but' here acts as a pivot in the conversation: rather than just responding with the expected acceptance of the recommendation, the father raises a new topic (coronavirus) and presents a new concern. This is the first time that coronavirus is mentioned in the consultation; there had been no lead up to the shift in conversation from the father at this point. The father's concern is expanded in lines 6-9 when he explains that he has heard that Nurofen\u00ae is not the best medication to use 'at the moment', that is, during the coronavirus pandemic. Here, the father refers to media reports at the time that suggested that ibuprofen might aggravate the symptoms of coronavirus (this link was subsequently debunked). 36, 37 Even though the child did not have coronavirus, the father expressed concern about using Nurofen\u00ae during the pandemic. From line 10, across an extended sequence, the doctor responds by providing both information and reassurance to the father. The father accepts this response from the doctor ('Yep that's fine' line 43, 'That's good to know', line 51), and finishes with an idiomatic expression ('better safe than sorry', line 76), which works to close this topic. 38, 39 This fragment shows how, during the pandemic, a relatively simple recommendation to give a child mild pain relief led to a parental concern being raised, and a need for the doctor to provide up-to-date information about COVID-19 and reassurance to the parent in response.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2110, "end": 2113, "text": "36,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2114, "end": 2116, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2582, "end": 2585, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 2586, "end": 2588, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic"}, {"text": "A second serious concern raised by parents within consultations recorded during the pandemic was attending the hospital for care. Prior to the pandemic, families often attended the hospital for regular consultations, including travelling long distances from remote towns to see clinicians face-to-face. As the next fragment shows, however, some parents expressed caution in visiting the hospital during the pandemic, even when concerned about their child's immediate health problems. In this next fragment, a telehealth consultation, the parents are concerned about their son's breathing. They had told the doctor previously that they did not want to visit the hospital due to the risk of COVID-19. [11] [12] . The father thus uses accentuated and emotive language to emphasise his perceived risk of visiting the hospital in person. This risk appears to be a greater concern to the parents than continuing to care for the child's health concern at home. This fragment shows another example of how serious concerns about the pandemic were raised by parents during consultations while discussing routine aspects of the child's ongoing care.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 699, "end": 703, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 704, "end": 708, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic"}, {"text": "A third form of talk about the COVID-19 pandemic became relevant in interactions when talking about issues related to the families' lifestyle, such as school (Fragment 7) and work (Fragment 8). This fragment begins with the same question from the doctor as seen in Fragment 2 above from the prepandemic consultations: asking what school the child attends. After receiving information from the child and father about the child's school and grade level, the doctor asks another question that shifts the conversation to the relevance of the pandemic. At the time of this consultation, schools were providing home learning and only children of essential workers were physically attending school. In this community-wide context of most children not attending school, asking the child about his school raises the relevance of the temporary change to school routine that the child would be experiencing. The doctor's next question, across lines 10-12, orients to this relevance by asking how long the child has been home from school. Both the child and father reply with the number of weeks the child has been home, and the father then expands by explaining that they were 'proactive' and the child started staying home from school around a week before the official school closures ('before the lockdowns happened', line 21). The father's response concluded with an idiomatic expression that they 'didn't want to take any chances'. 38, 39 With this response, the father displays to the doctor that he took the child's isolation from the community seriously and took precautions beyond the standard recommendations. Again, this fragment demonstrates how a routine question about the child's school, asked during the pandemic period, leads to a shift in the conversation to pandemic-related lifestyle changes including home-schooling and the father displaying he was taking isolation of the child seriously.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1425, "end": 1428, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1431, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic"}, {"text": "In Fragment 8, below, the child's father has already spoken about the child's mother (Mary) working as a nurse (discussed in Fragment 5 above). At the beginning, the doctor enquires about the father's own work responsibilities. The doctor's question at lines 1-3 is a routine question often observed in the paediatric palliative care consultations and can be compared to the similar question seen in Fragment 3 above. The father initially responds that he works 'from home at the moment' (line 5). With this initial response, the father already makes an apparent reference to the pandemic period, marking his current home-based work routine as being different to usual. In his expanded response across lines 7-10, the father explains he is in the 'gaming industry' and makes further reference to the pandemic in stating that 'everything's shut down at the moment it's very quiet'. In a similar way to the other fragments, the father's response to a routine question shifts the conversation to the changed routine due to COVID-19. Further in the sequence, the father explains that, 'before coronavirus,' he travelled one week in four for his work (lines [20] [21] .

The father confirms the financial impact and further shares that he had to take a 20% reduction in salary during this time (lines [30] [31] [32] [33] . He follows on with a positive stance, that this was better than losing his job (as many Australians did) and needing to rely on Government subsidy payments. The doctor provides an empathic receipt ('that's a relief', line 34) and adds that at least his wife's work (as a nurse) will continue. The father aligns with the doctor, using the idiomatic expression 'we're the lucky ones' to close down the sequence 38, 39 (line 39).

It adds to the small, and growing, body of research examining naturally-occurring communication within paediatric palliative care. 33, 34 A limitation of the study is that data were collected from one hospital in Australia. Another study limitation is that the diagnoses in this study are not totally representative of the patients in this service. Thirty-five percent of patients usually seen by this service have an oncologic diagnosis, not present in the current study. 46, 47 Future research might seek to include a representative group of diagnoses, to collect data at additional sites and locations, as well as during future waves of the pandemic (e.g., one State in Australia is currently experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 in July 2020, including cases within a Children's hospital).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 467, "end": 470, "text": "33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 471, "end": 473, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 809, "end": 812, "text": "46,", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 813, "end": 815, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strengths and limitations"}, {"text": "An awareness of the pervasiveness of both serious and non-serious talk about the COVID-19 pandemic within standard paediatric palliative care consultations during the pandemic can encourage clinicians to be prepared and flexible in how they respond to patients. In some instances, the pandemic influenced families' decision-making about the way their child received care from the palliative care service. For example, Fragment 6 showed that a family was hesitant to come to hospital for inpatient care. In other consultations, some concerns may be raised by families that require reassurance in response from clinicians. Other topics of conversation may require a sensitive acknowledgement of the additional life stressors that families can confront during pandemics (e.g., home schooling, financial stress due to loss of reliable employment). Pandemic topics may be raised also when discussing other psychosocial or lifestyle issues, such as education (e.g., remote school learning) or culture (e.g., television programs). Some of these conversations may involve more light-hearted discussion around the changes to everyday routines. Given the holistic purpose of paediatric palliative care in providing both medical and supportive care to families, 12-14 this service is in an ideal position to listen to and meet families' concerns to talk about pandemic-related matters that may potentially affect their child's health outcomes and family's everyday practices.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Practice implications"}, {"text": "Guidelines based on real-life conversations, rather than on imagined scripts of conversations, are more likely to show the diverse range of talk about the pandemic within clinical consultations. 35 It is unlikely that script writers could ever imagine the diversity of content, far broader than health concerns, that may surface within consultations during pandemics.
