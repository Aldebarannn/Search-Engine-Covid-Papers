            "text": "Initial evidence suggests that the use of social media as a source of information about COVID-19 has been correlated with stronger beliefs in conspiracy theories and with less protective behaviours during the pandemic. [9] Certainly, more than half of people on social media have encountered some to a lot of information about the COVID-19 pandemic which, for them, seemed completely made up. [2] Just in YouTube, the second most commonly used social media platform (second to Facebook), more than a quarter of the most viewed videos related to COVID-19 contained misleading information, representing more than 62 million views. [10] The World Health Organization (WHO) is acting by enhancing its communication efforts to properly address rapidly spreading rumours and questions from the public obtained in social media channels; also using search optimization strategies within the social media platforms to guide anyone asking questions about the pandemic by redirecting them to reliable sources. [5] Similarly, social media platforms themselves are including alerts or 'warnings' with links to reliable sources and fact-checkers when searching for information on COVID-19 and other health-related issues. [11] Although these represent good first steps, more is needed on the research efforts to understand the origins and spread of misinformation. Social media is an inevitable part of today's information channels. The risk of negative health effects (including death) from misguided health news in this pandemic is real. [12] Health professionals and scientists are unavoidably active social participants and have a responsibility to enter the arena. Here we expand on some advice/proposals for scientists obtained from different experts to counteract misinformation: [13] [14] [15] \u2022 Scientists should engage in social media. Sharing research knowledge with peers and learners is not only natural but desirable; furthermore, new evidence provides more certainty that social media can increase visibility and citations over time. [16] Sharing science is perfectly achievable and several strategies that take advantage of social networks technology can help (e.g., Tweetorials, Reddit's 'explain-it-like-I'm-5' , 'ask-me-anything [AMA] sessions, videos, etc.). [17, 18] \u2022 Assist and advocate for expert fact-checking. The scientist is the single greatest 'weapon' to counteract 'fake news'. Whether by serving as a professional factchecker for a news network, or by crowdsourcing (the use of multiple minds to reach a common goal of better knowledge) on any of these platforms, their shared knowledge will always be the best source to scrutinize the news. [19] \u2022 Interact in social media channels with non-experts (public) to raise the alarm when detecting misinformation by sharing the evidence or, if such is the case, by pointing out the scarcity of evidence and how we should make sensible recommendations under these circumstances -by weighing the desirable and undesirable consequences. [20] This includes teaching patients about science and how to deal with distressing interactions; for example, handling 'online trolls' by ignoring them, responding with facts, blocking them, etc. Guidelines and policies on this issue are available. [21] \u2022 Use, whenever possible, traditional media (TV or radio) to provide evidence-based information and reach a broader audience. This will eventually trickle down to social media users.",

[23, 24] AI can assist with this and other future developments as a robust computational research tool. It is encouraging to see that nowadays the most common use of AI for patients and healthcare consumers are secondary analyses of social media data.

Fact-checking of online content is certainly rapidly evolving, and its impact can be perceived when it is even creating major political disputes.
