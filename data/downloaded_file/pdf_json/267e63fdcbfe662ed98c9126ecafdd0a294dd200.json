Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in statistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature.

These estimates, denoted R t,\u03c4 , quantify the average transmissibility over a time window of length \u03c4 ending at time t. They are expected to be less variable as the window size \u03c4 increases, because 2 successive time windows will then have increasing overlap. As \u03c4 increases, the estimates of R t,\u03c4 will also be more precise. In fact, we show in Web Appendix 2 that the precision of these estimates depends directly on the number of incident cases in the time window [t \u2212 \u03c4 + 1; t].

However, times of infection are rarely observed, and the generation time distribution is therefore difficult to measure. On the other hand, the timing of onset of symptoms is usually known, and such data collected in closed settings where transmission can reliably be ascertained (e.g., households) can be used to estimate the distribution of the serial interval (time between onset of symptoms of a case and onset of symptoms of his/her secondary cases).

We found an initial median estimate of R of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0-1.9) at the end of week 2. Estimates were then quite stable until R peaked at 2.4 (95% CI: 2.2-2.6) in the middle of week 5 (coincident with the second highest peak in incidence). Estimates then decreased, with R falling below 1 early in week 7, before the largest peak in incidence (though around that peak, R estimates just exceed 1 for a few days). At the very end of the epidemic, the credible intervals widen because of low case numbers. Fraser et al. (20) found a similar temporal trend for R and attributed the decrease in R to social distancing measures that were undertaken around October 10 (day 40).

However, when the serial interval is long (e.g., for measles or smallpox), both effects are more dramatic, and the curves have very different interpretations. For the measles outbreak in Hallegoch, Germany, the highest estimate of R c is early in the epidemic, on the week ending on day 11, which reflects high transmissibility 2 weeks later (i.e., on the week ending on day 25), coinciding exactly with the peak in the estimated R. This means that the high transmissibility around day 25 is due to cases who have shown symptoms, on average, 2 weeks earlier. Similarly, for the smallpox epidemic in Kosovo, the peak in R c is on the week ending on day 15, and the peak in R is on the week ending on day 38 (i.e., 23 days later), which is the mean serial interval we have assumed. Transmissibility, measured by the instantaneous reproduction number, was very high during the second generation of cases, around day 38, but this was caused by the first generation of cases, who had symptoms around day 15.",

The case reproduction number (which is the quantity derived in those studies) is estimated over a generation of infection (i.e., over 8.4 days on average for SARS). When the instantaneous reproduction number is estimated on time windows shorter than the average generation time (which is the case for our weekly windows), we expect the case reproduction to be smoother than the instantaneous reproduction number, which could explain why we find higher peaks.

We showed in a simulation study that this should not dramatically affect estimates as long as the proportion of asymptomatic cases and the reporting rate are constant through time (Web Appendix 8). As an example, an early precursor of the method applied here was used to analyze time series of polio disease incidence, in which approximately 1 in 200 infections was symptomatic (33) . In some situations, the reporting rate is likely to change over the course of an epidemic, for instance, as a result of improved case ascertainment or case definitions or changes in health care-seeking behavior over time. If data on reporting are available, it is possible to extend our method to take variable reporting rates into account (6) .",
